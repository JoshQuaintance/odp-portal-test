__Correspondence Ontology Design Patterns (Correspondence OPs)__

Correspondence OPs include Reengineering OPs and Alignment OPs.


  




##   Description


Correspondence OPs include Reengineering OPs and Alignment OPs.
Reengineering OPs provide designers with solutions to the problem of transforming a conceptual model, which can even be a non-ontological resource,
into a new ontology. Alignment OPs are patterns for creating semantic associations between two existing ontologies.
