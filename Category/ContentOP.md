__Content Ontology Design Patterns (CPs)__

CPs are distinguished networked ontologies and have their own namespace. They cover a speciÔ¨Åc set of competency questions (requirements), which represent the problem they provide a solution for. Furthermore, CPs show certain characteristics, i.e. they are: computational, small, autonomous, hierarchical, cognitively relevant, linguistically relevant, and best practices. See  [evaluation principles](../Odp/EvaluationPrinciples "Odp:EvaluationPrinciples") for more details. 


  




##   Description


They show the following characteristics:
CPs encode conceptual, rather than logical design patterns. In other words,
while Logical OPs solve design problems independently of a particular conceptualization, CPs propose patterns for solving design problems for the domain
classes and properties that populate an ontology, therefore addressing con-
tent problems. CPs are instantiations of Logical OPs (or of compositions
of Logical OPs), featuring a non-empty signature. Hence, they have an explicit non-logical vocabulary for a specific domain of interest (i.e. they are
content-dependent). CPs provide solutions to domain modeling problems and
affect only the specific region of the ontology dealing with such domain modeling problems. They are typically reused by applying specialization, extension,
and composition to them. In principle, CPs do not depend on any specific
language, however in order to reuse them as building blocks, they have to be
implemented in some way. In the portal we mainly deal with CPs
in a Semantic Web context, hence we currently support OWL as a reference formalism for
representation.
