##   Description


Annotation ODPs provide annotation properties or annotation property schemas that are meant to improve the understandability of ontologies and their elements.


Examples are the use of RDF Schema labels and comments (crucial for manual selection and evaluation). Each class and property should be annotated with meaningful labels, i.e. by means of the annotation property rdfs:label, with also translations in different languages. Each ontology and ontology element should be annotated with the rationale they are based on, 
i.e. by means of the annotation property rdfs:comment.
