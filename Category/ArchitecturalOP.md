Architectural ODPs affect the overall shape of the ontology: their aim is to constrain ‘how the ontology should look like’. 


  




##   Description


Architectural ODPs affect the overall shape of the ontology: their aim is to constrain ‘how the ontology should look like’. Architectural ODPs emerged as design choices motivated by specific needs, e.g. computational complexity constraints. They are useful as reference documentation for those initially approaching the design of an ontology.
