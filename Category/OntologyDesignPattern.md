__Ontology Design Pattern (OP)__

An OP is a modeling solution to solve a recurrent ontology design problem. It is a template that represents a schema for specific design solutions. An ODP consists of a set of “prototypical” ontology entities that constitute the “abstract form” of a pattern, and of a set of metadata about its use cases, motivations, provenance, the pros and cons of its application, the links to other patterns, etc. Design solutions based on ODPs encode ontology entities that apply, specialize, or instantiate the prototypical entities defined by the schema.
