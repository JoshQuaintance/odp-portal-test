__Reengineering Ontology Design Patterns (Reengineering OPs)__

Reengineering OPs are transformation rules applied in order to create a new ontology (target model) starting from elements of a source model.


  




##   Description


Reengineering OPs are transformation rules applied in order to create a new
ontology (target model) starting from elements of a source model. The target
model is an ontology, while the source model can be either an ontology, or
a non-ontological resource e.g., a thesaurus concept, a data model pattern, a
UML model, a linguistic structure, etc.
Reengineering OPs are described in terms of metamodel transformation rules.
We distinguish two types of Reengineering OPs, Schema Re-engineering OPs and Refacoring OPs.
