__Alignment Ontology Design Patterns (Alignment OPs)__

Alignment OPs refer to correspondences between ontologies. Each pattern models a relation between two entities or sets of entities in two ontologies. Instantiation of an Alignment OP results in a correspondence between elements of two given ontologies.


  




##   Description
