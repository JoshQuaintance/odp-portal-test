##   Description


Reasoning OPs are applications of Logical OPs oriented to obtain certain
reasoning results, based on the behavior implemented in a reasoning engine.
Examples of Reasoning OPs include: classification, subsumption, inheritance, materialization, de-anonymizing, etc.
Reasoning OPs, when declared on top of an ontology, inform about the state
of that ontology, and let a system decide what reasoning has to be performed
on the ontology in order to carry out queries, evaluation, etc. Examples of
Reasoning OPs are so called normalizations.
