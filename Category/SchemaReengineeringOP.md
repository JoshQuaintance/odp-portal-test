__Schema Re-engineering Ontology Design Patterns (Schema Re-engineering OPs)__

Schema reengineering patterns are rules for transforming from a model in one formalism to another.


  



  




##   Description


Schema reengineering patterns are rules for transforming, e.g. a non-OWL DL
metamodel into an OWL DL ontology. For example, consider the use of SKOS
for Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS) reengineering to a knowledge
base (an OWL ABox), based-on the SKOS TBox. Transformation Logical OPs
are a kind of schema reengineering patterns. In principle, all modeling problems can be represented as higher-order logical expressions, and if we have to
represent them e.g. in OWL DL, we implicitly apply a schema reengineering
pattern in order to stay within the expressivity of OWL DL. However, we also
(pragmatically) distinguish between transformation and schema reengineering
patterns because of the different intention of the designer. In the first case,
the designer wants to directly represent a modeling solution in a certain representation formalism, e.g. OWL DL, while in the second case the designer
wants to reengineer, e.g. an existing non-OWL DL model into an OWL DL
ontology.
