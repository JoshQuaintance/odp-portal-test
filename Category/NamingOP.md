__Naming Ontology Design Patterns (Naming OPs)__

Naming OPs are conventions on how to create names for namespaces, Ô¨Åles, and ontology elements in general (classes, properties, etc.). 
  






  



  




##   Description


Naming OPs are good practices that boost ontology readability and understanding by humans, by supporting homogeneity in naming procedures.


Examples include conventions for how to construct the namespace declared for ontologies. It is recommended to use the base URI of the organization that publishes the ontology, e.g. [http://www.fao.org](http://www.fao.org "http://www.fao.org") for the FAO, followed by a reference directory for the ontologies, e.g. [http://www.fao.org/ontologies/](http://www.fao.org/ontologies/ "http://www.fao.org/ontologies/").
It is also important to choose an approach for encoding versioning, either on the name, or on the reference directory.
