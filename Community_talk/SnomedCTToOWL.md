This issue is quite broad in scope. There are probably multiple issues here that could be teased out. For example:



1. How to scope exactly what to extract from Snomed CT?
2. How to convert the extracted portion to OWL. This will depend entirely on the nature of the content. Does every module that you might extract have roughly the same structure?
3. How can we use Snomed CT classes for modeling the pharmaceutical clinical product and the dosage?
4. How can we use the resulting OWL model to achieve semantic interoperability among different pharma terminologies?


Even these issues are quite big. Try to get more specific with one, and take it from there. Starting with competency questions is a good idea. Also, to avoid misunderstandings, it is best to phrase a competency question as an actual question. For example:



1. What are the commercial drugs that are associated with a particular clinical drug?
2. What are the standard dosage units for a given clinical drug?
3. What are some other names of a given drug (e.g. from other terminologies)


Finally, to make it easier for people to help you:



1. be clear about exactly what you want an why.
2. say what you have thought about already and why it does not appear to be adequate.
