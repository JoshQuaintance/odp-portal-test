I have a comment to the __1st CQ__ and the content: pattern [http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/fsdas/speciesnames.owl](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/fsdas/speciesnames.owl "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/fsdas/speciesnames.owl")



* why do you put localName, synonym and canBeConfusedWith in one pattern?
* the first two are OK, but the 3rd is very differtent. This one should be objectProperty relating two species.
