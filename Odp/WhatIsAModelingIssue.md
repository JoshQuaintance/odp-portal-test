_Modeling Issue:_ A modeling issue is a question or problem that arises during the ontology engineering process. There are many kinds of issues and many ways to solve them. A modeling issue typically involves:



* not knowing how to proceed during an ontology engineering exercise
* identifying the specific representation requirements
* identifying what combinations of language constructs can meet the representation requirements
* evaluating the tradeoffs of different possible solutions.


A superb example of this is found in the document: [Representing Classes As Property Values on the Semantic Web](http://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-classes-as-values/ "http://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-classes-as-values/").


  

Two key ways that modeling issues vary are:



* _Domain Specificity:_ Modeling issues may be
	+ highly specific to narrow domains (_e.g._ protein folding in molecular biology)
	+ domain independent (_e.g._ Should instances of classes be modeled as SKOS:Concept).
	+ somewhere in between, _i.e._ broadly applicable in one or more fairly general domains.


* _How well defined:_ Modeling issues may be
	+ very clearly defined, with competency questions and proposed solution options with tradeoffs already analyzed
	+ very rough early thoughts from the person submitting.
	+ somewhere in between.
