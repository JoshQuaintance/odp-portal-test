##   Welcome to the 1st Workshop on Knowledge Injection into and Extraction from Linked Data


The first Workshop on Knowledge Injection into and Extraction from Linked Data is a co-located event with [EKAW 2010](http://ekaw2010.inesc-id.pt/ "http://ekaw2010.inesc-id.pt/"), [held in Lisbon (Portugal)](http://ekaw2010.inesc-id.pt/conference-venue.html "http://ekaw2010.inesc-id.pt/conference-venue.html"). It will be held on 15th October 2010.

##   Motivation and objectives


The first workshop on Knowledge Injection to and Extraction from Linked Data (KIELD2010 at [EKAW 2010](http://ekaw2010.inesc-id.pt/ "http://ekaw2010.inesc-id.pt/")) will gather three prominent sub-communities of Knowledge Engineering and Management: Knowledge Modelling, Knowledge Discovery and Linked Data. The rapid growth of the Linked Data cloud, in parallel with on-the-fly design of relevant vocabularies, presents new opportunities for traditional research disciplines.


Most notably:



* Although the popular vocabularies reflect today needs, they sometimes lack deeper ontological reflections. State-of-the-art knowledge modelling, especially the pattern-based ontology design principles, could help connect Linked Data vocabularies to more sophisticated models, while keeping themselves simple. Furthermore, collaborative ontology design methodologies could find their way to the process of vocabulary design, currently undertaken by VoCamp communities and stand-alone groups.
* The linked data themselves represent a large and growing resource woven from numerous components. Empirical knowledge discovery in linked data, carried out by machine learning and data mining algorithms, could reveal interesting patterns on frequently used structures, which could then be fuelled back to the vocabulary design. Existing techniques for mining network-structured data, such as graph databases or web links, are likely to require adaptation so as to take account of links that are typed according to semantically rich and heterogeneous schemata.


Aside the [EKAW 2010](http://ekaw2010.inesc-id.pt/ "http://ekaw2010.inesc-id.pt/") conference itself, the workshop is informally associated with the series of [WOP workshops - Workshops on Ontology Patterns](../WOP/2009.md "WOP:2009"). Participants of the previous successful WOP (1st edition at ISWC2009) are encouraged to submit to KIELD 2010.


By this interdisciplinary nature KIELD2010 aims at being of high interest for both researchers and practitioners of all three areas mentioned above. Furthermore, it will give space to ongoing and pioneering research activities, which would still be too preliminary as conference publications, although extremely hot as topics in the semantic technology field.



##   Key topics


The workshop welcomes research, application, and position papers on the following topics (non-exclusive):



###   Ontology engineering for Linked Data


* Methodologies

* Ontology patterns identification and discovery
* Pattern-based triplification
* Anti-patterns or worst practices


###   Data mining from Linked Data


* Entity recognition
* Link prediction
* Pattern mining
* Sequential patterns
* Rule mining


###   Linked Data in use


* Domain applications based-on linked data
* Linked data exploitation
* Interaction with linked data

17:40 - 18:00 Wrap-up



##   Keynote Talk


* _Martin Hepp:_ Ontology Engineering for Linked Data: What Makes For A Good Ontology?


The talk will discuss the impact of ontology design choices and ontology quality criteria on the overall impact of the linked data initiatives.
In particular, it will analyze whether there are good and bad ontologies from a practical standpoint, what quality criteria will matter the most, and how this relates to the "raw data now" movement in the community.


  




##   Paper Submission


Two types of submissions will be accepted: full papers presenting recent research results, and position papers presenting either research in progress or key issues in the scientific discussion. 


All submissions have to be formatted according to the Springer LNCS format, in PDF. Full papers are limited to 12 pages and position papers to 6 pages.



##   Accepted Papers


* _Laura Dragan, Alexandre Passant, Tudor Groza and Siegfried Handschuh:_ Linking Personal Semantic Notes
* _Francesco Valle, Mathieu d'Aquin, Tommaso Di Noia and Enrico Motta:_ LOTED: Exploiting Linked Data in Analyzing European Procurement Notices
* _Thomas Markotschi and Johanna Voelker:_ GuessWhat?!
* _Miroslav Vacura and Vojtech Svatek:_ Ontological Analysis of Human Relations for Semantically Consistent Transformations of FOAF Data
* _Andrea Giovanni Nuzzolese, Aldo Gangemi, Paolo Ciancarini and Valentina Presutti:_ Semion: a smart triplification tool
* _Claudio Baldassarre:_ Semantic Skin: from flat textual content to interconnected repositories of semantic data (Demo paper) __Withdrawn__


The accepted papers will be published in workshop notes, under CEUR.



##   Late breaking news


We invite submissions in the form of 2-pages extended
abstracts in LNCS style presenting work relevant to the workshop topics.
Interesting results to be submitted could be either non-mature promising recent work, or already published results e.g. accepted to another venue (journal or conference). 
The goal of the session is to gather the community interested
in the KIELD themes, stimulate discussions, and favor exchange of ideas.
Instead of regular review process, these submissions will
just undergo a relevance check. The abstracts will be part of the
electronic workshop proceedings (CEUR) as a special section.
A short oral presentation from by the authors will be scheduled during the workshop day.



###   Late breaking news Submission


Submissions must be sent to [KIELD chairs](mailto:kield2010@inrialpes.fr "mailto:kield2010@inrialpes.fr") by August 27th (midnight CET).
