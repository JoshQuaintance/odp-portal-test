* [What do you mean by an _exemplary ontology_?](../Odp/WhatIsAnExemplaryOntology.md "Odp:WhatIsAnExemplaryOntology").


  




* Q: __Who should submit exemplary ontologies__
* A: The person should 1) have significant knowledge of the ontology (ideally from using it in applications) and 2) significant experience with a number of other ontologies so they can see differences in quality.


  




* Q: __Can I submit my own ontology?__
* A: Submissions are ideally made by champions of the ontology rather than by the developers (to avoid conflict of interest). However there are exceptions. For example:
	+ An exemplary ontology is relatively new and has not been exposed to the outside long enough to have champions.
	+ An exemplary ontology is in a very narrow domain and does not have enough potential external users, even though it has been extensively used and refined and reused within a group.


The main critera for including an ontology is whether it is something that others are likely to draw inspiriation from and emulate. 


  




* Q: __What if I disagree that a submitted ontology is exemplary?__
* This is a Wiki, let your views be known. Start a discussion using the discussion tab. In some cases you may wish to enter comments in the  [Known Issues](../Property/KnownIssues.md "Property:KnownIssues") field.


  




* Q: __Can I add to or change the content of a submitted Exemplary Ontology__
* A: This is a Wiki, let your views be known. Per Wiki convention, it may be best to start a discussion first, before making large changes.


  




* Q: __Should I submit an ontology that is exemplary in most ways if it has significant flaws?__
* A: If you think the community should know about the exemplary aspects of this ontology (especially if it has a significant user community), then it makes sense to submit it. Clearly indicate the flaws in the Known Issues field and elaborate as necessary in the Long Description or Additional Information field.


  




* Q: __What should I do if there are one or more parts of an ontology that are exemplary, but overall I do not consider the ontology to be exemplary?__
* A: If an exemplary part exists as a separate module, (e.g. an imported .owl file) then enter it on its own. You may also wish to see if it uses existing design patterns, and augment the documentation with the new example. Or perhaps you can identify a new design pattern that this module illustrates.


  




* Q: __Can I enter ontologies that are not in OWL?__
* A: Yes, enter the URI for your ontology in the Otology URI field. Please ensure that others can easily find out what language is being used. Often this is evident from the URI (e.g. if it ends in .owl or .rdfs).


  




* Q: __How do I know what Domains are available to choose from? How can I add a new one?__
* A: [Click here to see existing domains](../Category/Domain.md "Category:Domain") and [click here to add a new domain](../Form/Domain_Form.md "Form:Domain Form").
