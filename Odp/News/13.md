__Title:__ Two open position at STLab CNR Italy (one junior researcher and one post-doc)


__Description:__ OPEN POSITION for n.1 (one) Junior Researcher at the Semantic Technology Laboratory of the Institute for Cognitive Science and Technologies (ISTC-CNR). 


PROJECT: "Cloud interoperable platforms for smart-government" (PRISMA) 
Topic: Design and development of algorithms for knowledge pattern extraction from heterogeneous sources and definition of methods and metrics for their validation
Funding Institution: Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) 
Type of Grant: "Junior Researcher (Graduate Fellowship - Assegno di Ricerca)" (this is a tax-free contract for the employee)
Employer: Institute of Cognitive Science and Technologies of CNR
Salary: 19.367,00 net of expenses in charge of CNR 
Starting from: June 2013
Duration: 12 months (renewable)
Location: Catania, Italy
Deadline for letter of intent: 12 May 2013
Official application deadline: 22 May 2013 
Link to the official application post: [http://bit.ly/XVeTWp](http://bit.ly/XVeTWp "http://bit.ly/XVeTWp") (in Italian, the English translation is available at the bottom of the page)
Scientific responsible: Dr. Valentina Presutti
Contact person (letter of intent): Dr. Valentina Presutti valentina.presutti@cnr.it
Contact person (administrative issues): stefania.capotosti@istc.cnr.it


  

There will be a public selection procedure, based on professional and scientific titles and on an interview, for the assignment of n. 1 (one) - "Junior Researcher (Graduate Fellowship)". The related scientific area is "Computer Science" and the selected candidate will be located at the Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies, CNR, Via Gaifami 18, Catania, in the scope of the project: "PRISMA", funded by the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) of Italy. The main research topic associated with the position is: "Design and development of algorithms for knowledge pattern extraction from heterogeneous sources and definition of methods and metrics for their validation.". The research work will be conducted under the scientific responsibility of Dr. Valentina Presutti.


Research Project: The context of this research activity is the study and development of the Semantic Web. The selected candidate will analyse and develop algorithms for extracting knowledge patterns from heterogeneous sources, which are typical of the Web. The goal is to build formalized patterns that emerge from collective knowledge existing on the Web, and to demonstrate that such patterns are effective as means for improving the automatic interpretation and the interaction with large-scale information and data sources (with particular focus on Web content). The developed algorithms will leverage and extend existing techniques of knowledge extraction. The effectiveness of extracted patterns will be evaluated with new evaluation metrics, as well as with the design and performance of user-based experimental studies in the area of social knowledge management for the Italian Public Administration.


It is highly recommended to send a letter of intention for candidature, along with CV and at least one recommendation letter before May 12th to Dr. Valentina Presutti (valentina.presutti@cnr.it). The email subject must be “intention to apply to Position n. 199/2013”. The candidate will be contacted for an informal interview that will precede the official one. The aim of the formal interview is to advise the candidate on how to prepare to the official selection as well as to answer possible questions about the environment and other possible matters of interests of the candidate.


STLab is a highly dynamic and distributed research environment where researchers work collaboratively for advancing the state of the art in semantic technologies. The Catania office has been created this year and is located in Catania, a city with wonderful climate all year long and with a lively social life. The international Catania airport offers connections to key international destinations, including several low-cost airline flights.

Research Project: The context of this research activity is automatic linked data production for the Semantic Web. The selected candidate will develop methods for machine reading of natural language text based on its transformation to logical models compliant with Semantic Web standards. The goal is to automatically produce linked data and ontologies starting from natural language (English and Italian as basic languages) and using them for interaction tasks such as question-answering, summarization, etc. Case studies will include, in particular, the integration of data and text for social knowledge management in the Italian Public Administration.
