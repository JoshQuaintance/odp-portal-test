__Title:__ Workshop on Ontology Patterns (WOP) accepted at ISWC 2009!


__Description:__ [Visit WOP's homepage](../../WOP/2009.md "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/WOP:2009")
This will be the first edition in a series of yearly workshops addressing the emerging topic of ontology patterns, related to the _ontologydesignpatterns.org_ initiative. Patterns need to be shared by a community in order to provide a common language, hence the aim of this workshop is twofold; both providing an arena for proposing and discussing patterns, pattern-based ontologies, systems etc., and broadening the pattern community that will develop its own “language” for discussing and describing relevant problems and their solutions. 


The first workshop will be held at ISWC on October 25th 2009. It will be a full-day workshop consisting of three parts; paper presentations, posters, and “pattern writing” sessions. For the pattern writing sessions ontology design patterns will be submitted and reviewed at _ontologydesignpatterns.org_, including the assignment of an advisor for each accepted pattern submission.
