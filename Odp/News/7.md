__Title:__ Collaborative eXtreme Design Camp in Bologna


__Description:__ A successful collaborative eXtreme ontology Design camp culminated the  [Computational Ontologies PhD course](../../Training/PhD_Course_on_Computational_Ontologies_@_University_of_Bologna.1.md "Training:PhD Course on Computational Ontologies @ University of Bologna"), which has been held at University of Bologna Computer Science Department. 16 students attended the 10-day course and in the last day a camp has been organized, with a simulation of a customer providing realistic stories, XD engineers tutoring, and students organized into pairs modellig different stories after decompressing them into competency questions. A pair performed as integrator.
The camp provided excellent results in rapid prototyping of accurate ontologies, easy interaction with the customer, and collaboration between modeling teams.
