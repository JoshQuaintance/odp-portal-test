#  Tasks/Distinguishing Open and QC Reviews


__Title:__ Distinguishing Open and QC Reviews


__Description:__ Each Proposed Content OP has the possibility to be reviewed from its page by clicking on 'post a review'. But if you are not a member of the QC you face an error page.


I would like to fix this in the following way:



* + We allow all registered user to post a review but we distinguish QC reviews from open ones.
	+ Is it possible to have only one link in the page (the one that is already there) and to redirect the user to either an 'Open Review' if (s)he is not a QC member, or to the official review if (s)he is a QC member?
* Motivations are the following:
	+ The regular discussion pages are not effectively perceived from users.
	+ We want have an open review mechanism as well as an official one.
	+ It is bad that a user is faced with an error page when his/her intent is to post a comment on a wiki. At least (s)he should be redirected to the correct page where is allowed to post. However, t would be much better to make such process transparent to the user (as described above).

This was a bug in the wiki code.
