__Title:__ Make it easy to add images to Modeling Issues


__Description:__ Now, to include an image in a modeling issue entry, it is necessary to manaully use the  ["Include Image" template](../../Template/Include_Image.md "Template:Include Image") in the free text field. It might be nice to add a field to the modeling issues template for one or more images, as is done for the patterns. It is not clear how best to deal with more than one image. Most flexibility is to manually use  ["Graphical representation" template](../../Template/Include_Image.md "Template:Include Image") wherever needed. Might be useful to have a special image field for a primar image that would go at the top.

A field for a single Image has been added to the modeling issue form.

The name - _Include image_ - is probably misleading, it has been changed everywhere in _Graphical representation_.


The _Include Image_ template has not been deleted, so it can be used in free text.


__Important: do not use the template Grahical representation in free text because it is used by the forms__


Anyway, in general, to include an image is better to use simple wiki syntax:




```

[[Image:Place.png]]

```

that will render:


[![Image:Place.png](../../images/f/f7/Place.png)](../../Image/Place.png.md "Image:Place.png")
