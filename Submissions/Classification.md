[![ObjectProperty](../../images/thumb/c/c3/ObjectProperty.gif/20px-ObjectProperty.gif)](../Image/ObjectProperty.gif.md "ObjectProperty") __classifies__ (owl:ObjectProperty) A relation between a  [Concept](../Submissions/Classification/Concept.md "Submissions:Classification/Concept") and an  [Entity](../Submissions/Classification/Entity.md "Submissions:Classification/Entity"), e.g. the Role 'student' classifies a Person 'John'.
