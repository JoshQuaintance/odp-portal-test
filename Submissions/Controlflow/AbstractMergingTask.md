__Description__: An abstract merging task is a merging aimed at 'formally' joining the tasks that are direct successor to a case task.


Differently from synchronization tasks, which are expected to be executed, abstract mergings only provide abstract boundaries to a task structure, because in a case task, only one action task is supposed to be executed.
