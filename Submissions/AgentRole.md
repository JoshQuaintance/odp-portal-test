#  Additional information


The  [time indexed person role](../Submissions/Time_indexed_person_role.md "Submissions:Time indexed person role") CP allows to represent temporariness of roles played by persons. It can be generalized for including objects or, alternatively the  [n-ary classification](../Submissions/Nary_Participation.md "Submissions:Nary Participation") CP can be specialized in order to obtain the same expressivity.


The elements of this Content OP are added with the elements of its components and/or the elements of the Content OPs it is a specialization of.
