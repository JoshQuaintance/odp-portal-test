#  General description


  




#  Elements


_The __DescriptionAndSituation__ Content OP locally defines the following ontology elements:_



[![ObjectProperty](../images/thumb/c/c3/ObjectProperty.gif/20px-ObjectProperty.gif)](../Image/ObjectProperty.gif.md "ObjectProperty") __describes__ (owl:ObjectProperty) The relation between a Description and an EntityÂ : a Description gives a unity to a Collection of parts (the components), or constituents, by assigning a Role to each of them in the context of a whole Object (the system).
A same Entity can be given different descriptions, for example, an old cradle can be given a unifying Description based on the original aesthetic design, the functionality it was built for, or a new aesthetic functionality in which it can be used as a flower pot.

[![ObjectProperty](../images/thumb/c/c3/ObjectProperty.gif/20px-ObjectProperty.gif)](../Image/ObjectProperty.gif.md "ObjectProperty") __isDescribedBy__ (owl:ObjectProperty) The relation between any Thing and a Description: a Description gives a unity to a Collection of parts (the components), or constituents, by assigning a Role to each of them in the context of a whole Object (the system).
A same Thing can be given different descriptions, for example, an old cradle can be given a unifying Description based on the original aesthetic design, the functionality it was built for, or a new aesthetic functionality in which it can be used as a flower pot.

[![ObjectProperty](../images/thumb/c/c3/ObjectProperty.gif/20px-ObjectProperty.gif)](../Image/ObjectProperty.gif.md "ObjectProperty") __isSatisfiedBy__ (owl:ObjectProperty) A relation between a Situation and a Description, e.g. the execution of a Plan satisfies that plan.

#  Modeling issues



__Modeling issues about DescriptionAndSituation__

The Description and Situation content ontology design pattern. This CP represents conceptualizations i.e., descriptions, and corresponding groundings i.e., situations. The pattern is extracted from DOLCE+DnS Ultralite by partial cloning of elements, and is composed of three other CPs: description, situation, and classification.
