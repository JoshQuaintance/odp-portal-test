[![ObjectProperty](../images/thumb/c/c3/ObjectProperty.gif/20px-ObjectProperty.gif)](../Image/ObjectProperty.gif.md "ObjectProperty") __hasPart__ (owl:ObjectProperty) Indicates that a unit includes another unit.

[![Class](../images/thumb/2/27/Class.gif/20px-Class.gif)](../Image/Class.gif.md "Class") __Creator__ (owl:Class) The creator of a born digital archive unit

[![Class](../images/thumb/2/27/Class.gif/20px-Class.gif)](../Image/Class.gif.md "Class") __File__ (owl:Class) An organized unit of documents grouped together either for current use by the creator or in the process of archival arrangement, because they relate to the same subject, activity, or transaction. A file is usually the basic unit within a record series. 
 [![](../images/thumb/8/87/ArrowRight.gif/11px-ArrowRight.gif)](../Image/ArrowRight.gif.md "ArrowRight.gif") _[File](../Submissions/Born_Digital_Archives/File.md "Submissions:Born Digital Archives/File") page_
[![Class](../images/thumb/2/27/Class.gif/20px-Class.gif)](../Image/Class.gif.md "Class") __Fonds__ (owl:Class) _Fonds_: The whole of the records, regardless of form or medium, organically created and/or accumulated and used by a particular person, family, or corporate body in the course of that creator's activities and functions.  

_Sub-fonds_: A subdivision of a fonds containing a body of related records corresponding to administrative subdivisions in the originating agency or organization or, when that is not possible, to geographical, chronological, functional, or similar groupings of the material itself. When the creating body has a complex hierarchical structure, each sub-fonds has as many subordinate sub-fonds as are necessary to reflect the levels of the hierarchical structure of the primary subordinate administrative unit.
