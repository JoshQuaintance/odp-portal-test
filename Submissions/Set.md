#  Additional information


A Set is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. A Set is expressed by linking to it directly all the members (elements), multiple identical values of members (elements) will be eliminated because by default they are treated as a set.


The collections ontology (part of the SWAN ontologies) that this pattern is based on was created by Paolo Ciccarese - Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, and Marco Ocana - Balboa Systems Inc.
