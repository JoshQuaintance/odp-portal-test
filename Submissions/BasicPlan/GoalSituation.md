__Description__: A goal situation is a situation that satisfies a goal.Opposite to the case of subplan executions, a goal situation is not part of a plan execution.In other words, it is not true in general that any situation satisfying a part of a description, is also part of the situation that satisfies the whole description. This helps to account for the following cases: a) Execution of plans containing abort or suspension conditions (the plan would be satisfied even if the goal has not been reached, see below), b) Incidental satisfaction, like when a situation satisfies a goal without being intentionally planned (but anyway desired).
