__Description__: The process of doing something. An action is performed by an agent. An action can be proposed (proposed actions make up a plan), implemented or abandoned, and it has a status and possibly one or more suspension periods. Actions can have consequences and can be dependent on other actions, e.g. the action of pouring water from a cup is dependent on the action to first fill the cup with water.
