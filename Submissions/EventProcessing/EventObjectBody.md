__Type:__ owl:Class 


__Description__: Some event processing systems need to distinguish between an event object header and its body, where the event object header is the part of the event object with known content (e.g. known vocabulary) that can be directly processed by the event processing system, and the body is the rest of the event object. The body may always be empty or missing.
