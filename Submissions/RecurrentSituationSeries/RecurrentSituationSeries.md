__Name__: RecurrentSituationSeries 


__Type:__ owl:Class 


__Description__: Recurrent situation series is modeled as an intersection of the classes Collection and Situation. Indeed, a recurrent situation is seen as a collection, since it contains entities that share one or more common properties and are unified conceptually. These entities are member of the collection, and are all consecutive situations, in such a manner that each situation has either a previous situation, or a next situation, or both, unless the series has never been instantiated. At the same time, a recurrent situation is a situation, intended as a relational context in which the contextualized things are based on a frame: a recurrent situation is similar to a plan that defines how the things involved in that plan (i.e. the specific situations) shall be carried out, e.g. where the situations shall be located, in which time of the year, etc.
