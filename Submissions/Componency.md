#  General description


  




#  Elements


_The __Componency__ Content OP locally defines the following ontology elements:_




[![Class](../images/thumb/2/27/Class.gif/20px-Class.gif)](../Image/Class.gif.md "Class") __Object__ (owl:Class) Any physical, social, or mental object, or a substance. Can be component only of other objects, and can be composed of only other objects.

[![ObjectProperty](../images/thumb/c/c3/ObjectProperty.gif/20px-ObjectProperty.gif)](../Image/ObjectProperty.gif.md "ObjectProperty") __hasComponent__ (owl:ObjectProperty) The  [hasPart](../Submissions/PartOf/hasPart.md "Submissions:PartOf/hasPart") relation without transitivity, holding between an  [Object](../Submissions/Componency/Object.md "Submissions:Componency/Object") (the system) and another (the component), and assuming a Design that structures the system Object. 
The componency Content OP uses the transitive reduction  [logical pattern](../Category/LogicalOP.md "Category:LogicalOP") to preserve transitive on the superproperty from the [part of](../Submissions/PartOf.md "Submissions:PartOf") Content OP. In practice, the [part of](../Submissions/PartOf.md "Submissions:PartOf") acts here as the transitive reduction of the  __componency__ Content OP.

[![ObjectProperty](../images/thumb/c/c3/ObjectProperty.gif/20px-ObjectProperty.gif)](../Image/ObjectProperty.gif.md "ObjectProperty") __isComponentOf__ (owl:ObjectProperty) The inverse of the  [hasComponent](../Submissions/Componency/hasComponent.md "Submissions:Componency/hasComponent")  object property.
