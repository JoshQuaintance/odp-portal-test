#  General description


  




#  Elements


_The __Experience & Observation__ Content OP locally defines the following ontology elements:_



[![Class](../images/thumb/2/27/Class.gif/20px-Class.gif)](../Image/Class.gif.md "Class") __Engagement__ (owl:Class) The product of a reflection upon an observation, which embodies subjective traits of an experience (Example: "After reading this passage of 'To Kill a Mockingbird', I came to a clearer understanding of the many facets of social intolerance"). 
 [![](../images/thumb/8/87/ArrowRight.gif/11px-ArrowRight.gif)](../Image/ArrowRight.gif.md "ArrowRight.gif") _[Engagement](../Submissions/Experience_&_Observation/Engagement.md "Submissions:Experience & Observation/Engagement") page_
[![Class](../images/thumb/2/27/Class.gif/20px-Class.gif)](../Image/Class.gif.md "Class") __Observation__ (owl:Class) The product of an act of scrutiny which may or may not have been performed with a critical disposition (Example: "My thoughts from reading this passage of 'To Kill a Mockingbird'"). 
 [![](../images/thumb/8/87/ArrowRight.gif/11px-ArrowRight.gif)](../Image/ArrowRight.gif.md "ArrowRight.gif") _[Observation](../Submissions/Experience_&_Observation/Observation.md "Submissions:Experience & Observation/Observation") page_
[![ObjectProperty](../images/thumb/c/c3/ObjectProperty.gif/20px-ObjectProperty.gif)](../Image/ObjectProperty.gif.md "ObjectProperty") __inActivity__ (owl:ObjectProperty) what activity/ies are affecting or affected by a certain engagement 
 [![](../images/thumb/8/87/ArrowRight.gif/11px-ArrowRight.gif)](../Image/ArrowRight.gif.md "ArrowRight.gif") _[inActivity](../Submissions/Experience_&_Observation/inActivity.md "Submissions:Experience & Observation/inActivity") page_
[![ObjectProperty](../images/thumb/c/c3/ObjectProperty.gif/20px-ObjectProperty.gif)](../Image/ObjectProperty.gif.md "ObjectProperty") __isReflectionOn__ (owl:ObjectProperty) Used to connect the subjective elements of an experience with the corresponding observation, which is extrapolated from the content being interacted with and in itself may not be including a critique. 
 [![](../images/thumb/8/87/ArrowRight.gif/11px-ArrowRight.gif)](../Image/ArrowRight.gif.md "ArrowRight.gif") _[isReflectionOn](../Submissions/Experience_&_Observation/isReflectionOn.md "Submissions:Experience & Observation/isReflectionOn") page_
[![ObjectProperty](../images/thumb/c/c3/ObjectProperty.gif/20px-ObjectProperty.gif)](../Image/ObjectProperty.gif.md "ObjectProperty") __isReflectedUponIn__ (owl:ObjectProperty) Inverse of isReflectionOn 
 [![](../images/thumb/8/87/ArrowRight.gif/11px-ArrowRight.gif)](../Image/ArrowRight.gif.md "ArrowRight.gif") _[isReflectedUponin](../Submissions/Experience_&_Observation/isReflectedUponin.md "Submissions:Experience & Observation/isReflectedUponin") page_
[![ObjectProperty](../images/thumb/c/c3/ObjectProperty.gif/20px-ObjectProperty.gif)](../Image/ObjectProperty.gif.md "ObjectProperty") __isEngagedIn__ (owl:ObjectProperty) Because an activity may engage other participants than the one performing it, engagements are in general considered individual rather than collective, therefore each participants has their own engagement and only some of them will be conscious and/or documented. 
 [![](../images/thumb/8/87/ArrowRight.gif/11px-ArrowRight.gif)](../Image/ArrowRight.gif.md "ArrowRight.gif") _[isEngagedIn](../Submissions/Experience_&_Observation/isEngagedIn.md "Submissions:Experience & Observation/isEngagedIn") page_
[![ObjectProperty](../images/thumb/c/c3/ObjectProperty.gif/20px-ObjectProperty.gif)](../Image/ObjectProperty.gif.md "ObjectProperty") __hasEngagement__ (owl:ObjectProperty) inverse of inActivity 
 [![](../images/thumb/8/87/ArrowRight.gif/11px-ArrowRight.gif)](../Image/ArrowRight.gif.md "ArrowRight.gif") _[hasEngagement](../Submissions/Experience_&_Observation/hasEngagement.md "Submissions:Experience & Observation/hasEngagement") page_
[![ObjectProperty](../images/thumb/c/c3/ObjectProperty.gif/20px-ObjectProperty.gif)](../Image/ObjectProperty.gif.md "ObjectProperty") __producedObservation__ (owl:ObjectProperty) This property can be used to denote that something is (even indirectly, not necessary through direct reflection) responsible for the existence of an observation. 
 [![](../images/thumb/8/87/ArrowRight.gif/11px-ArrowRight.gif)](../Image/ArrowRight.gif.md "ArrowRight.gif") _[producedObservation](../Submissions/Experience_&_Observation/producedObservation.md "Submissions:Experience & Observation/producedObservation") page_
[![ObjectProperty](../images/thumb/c/c3/ObjectProperty.gif/20px-ObjectProperty.gif)](../Image/ObjectProperty.gif.md "ObjectProperty") __includes__ (owl:ObjectProperty) A relation of mereological nature that connects a given observation with the activity that originates them: it strengthens the argument that observations are always active processes from a cognitive standpoint, regardless of how conscious they may be. 
A standard mereological property from another content pattern may be used in lieu of this one and therefore aligned with it.
