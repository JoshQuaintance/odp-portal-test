#  Additional information


Our work was inspired by ideas from Spatial Information Theory, biomedical research for the Semanticscience Integrated Ontology (SIO), Mereotopology, and geospatial data efforts via the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), although these are not the only works regarding spatial descriptions.


With the capabilities the SGA pattern provides, it has been found to be useful and as been implemented for IFC, GBXML, and CityGML is currently in progress. Once this mapping was produced and captured via this pattern, further work was possible and completed in the form of View helper files and all of this is being worked into an operational Linked Data Platform to further enhance open data exchange.


For the development of the pattern and for versions of data standards worked with thus far, we have crossed-checked our research with a team of Ontologists, Computer Scientists, Architects, Engineers, and other domain experts. We have also built a visualization method to verify what is being populated within the pattern relative to what data was in the original spatial schema instance file. The pattern has been used with a set of six test models ranging in complexity from one room to sixty-plus rooms on multiple levels. Additional models are planned to be tested in future iterations of the work.
