##   PRE-MEETING NOTES FROM SELECTED EMAILS


Pascal Hitzler:
1. I volunteer to chair but happily defer to Eva or Valentina if they like to do it. Cogan Shimizu has already volunteered to be scribe but he is also happy to leave it to somebody else.


  

2. Additional issues can also simply be discussed in agenda point 7. Regarding process, please note that we have to improvise a bit because we forgot to hold a meeting last year. Unless anyone objects, I simply suggest that the Board is the same as it would have been last year, for purposes of decisions and voting. I.e., board members are: Blomqvist, Hitzler, Presutti, Gangemi, Hammar, Janowicz, Lawrynowicz, Krisnadhi, Nuzzolese, Salmons


  

3. I understand that the portal needs moving, quickly. We want to collect concrete ideas how to deal with that, and who may be available for this to actually put in place on short notice.


  

4. The terms of all current board members expire (see list at <[http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/ODPA](../ODPA "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/ODPA")>). Board members for the next cycle are nominated by the current board, and elected by all members (member list on the same page). 


  

5. The terms of all Managing Committee members expire. Eva and Pascal have both indicated that they would favor handing over the staff to the next generation, but both would like to stay on the Board. The Board elects the Managing Committee members.


  

6. Decided by the new board.


  

Modus operandus for voting: Voting will be done by designating a trusted member who would receive the votes through the zoom chat by individual message. I volunteer to be that person for all votes which do not concern me personally. I proposed this method of voting to the board two weeks ago and there were no objections.
Eva Blomqvist:
similar to Pascal, I would also like to withdraw from the managing committee and hence also from the role as chair of the ODPA board.
Again, similar to Pascal, I am happy to remain on the board, as I am still (at least somewhat) active in this field and care about what happens to WOP, the portal etc.
Valentina Presutti:
I am willing to resign from my role of vice-chair although I would like to remain in the board as, just as I mentioned before, my group is strongly involved in ODP research and is following, maintaining and supporting all initiatives since many years and willing to continue doing it with renewed interest and participation.


  

Agnieszka Ławrynowicz: 
I would like to resign from the Board for the next round, but to keep my presence in the ODPA association (I have had lower activity in the topic of ODPs lately, but still keep an interest in the area). 


  




##   MINUTES


1. Determination of a meeting chair and a scribe.


  

Pascal will chair.
Cogan will scribe.


  

2. Changes to the agenda or process, if any.


  

No changes.


  

3. Report on portal status (it needs moving) and ideas for fixing the issues, including possibly revamping the portal completely.


  

Andrea: Portal needs moving within a month (currently hosted by CNR). There is a new server that can be used. Or it could go somewhere else. There are two different discussions: physical location and software implementation migration. So probably needs first a quick move, then modernizing the portal. Can provide all materials on dependences, plugins, etc.


  

Ideas on the table:



* Andrea volunteers to do what’s needed to keep the portal alive for now. A minimal move and then redesign can be taken care of.
* Luigi can also help.
* Cogan can also help.
