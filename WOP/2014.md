##   Welcome to the Workshop on Ontology and Semantic Web Patterns (5th edition) - WOP2014


This is the fifth edition in a series of workshops addressing the topic of __ontology and semantic web patterns as best practices__, related to the [_ontologydesignpatterns.org_](../Ontology_Design_Patterns_._org_(ODP).md).html "Ontology Design Patterns . org (ODP)") initiative. 


This edition of WOP will be the very first in Europe, in which traditionally the design pattern community for semantic web and linked data has been very strong. As interest in the Semantic Web increases and technologies for realizing the Semantic Web become more mature, the need for high-quality and reusable Semantic Web ontologies increases as well. To address the quality and reusability issues, different types of Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) have emerged, and methods for devising or discovering new ones from heterogeneous knowledge sources are needed.


Patterns need to be shared by a community in order to provide a common language, and to stimulate pattern usage and development. Hence, the aim of this workshop is twofold 



* providing an arena for proposing and discussing good practices, patterns, pattern-based ontologies, systems etc., and
* broadening the pattern community that is developing its own “language” for discussing and describing relevant problems and their solutions.


For more background on the workshop series, see the  [main page](../WOP/Main.md "WOP:Main").


WOP2014 will be a _full-day workshop_ consisting of two parts: paper presentations and posters. The poster session will feature pattern posters, i.e. presentations of patterns submitted according the  [call for patterns](../WOP/2014.md#Call_for_Patterns "WOP:2014").

* _Title_: Fueling the future with Semantic Web Patterns
* _Abstract_: I will claim that Semantic Web Patterns can drive the next technological breakthrough: they can be key for providing intelligent applications with sophisticated ways of interpreting data. I will picture scenarios of a possible not so far future in order to support my claim. I will argue that current Semantic Web Patterns are not sufficient for addressing the envisioned requirements, and I will suggest a research direction for fixing the problem, which includes the hybridization of existing computer science pattern-based approaches, and human computing.

* Evaluation of ODPs (methods, benchmarks)


  




* Patterns and Linked data (usage, emerging patterns, etc.)
* Linked Data patterns, patterns for using different vocabularies together
* Web semantics from a pattern perspective
* ODPs used for interaction with data
* Data mining patterns

* Usage of patterns in Semantic Web design
* Collaborative ontology design and collaboration patterns
* Tools and applications for pattern-based knowledge engineering


  




* Ontology Patterns for specific domains (cultural heritage, digital humanities, multimedia, etc).


##   Call for Patterns


We invite the submission of research results in the form of ontology design patterns (ODPs). 
Patterns submitted should have a general relevance to the ontology engineering field, or specific interest within a knowledge domain. Patterns should solve some particular modeling problem, and be of significant interest for discussion at the workshop. Patterns should be original, in the sense that they are the intellectual product of the author(s), however they may still be based on the collective experience of a community.


Pattern submissions for the pattern session will be collected:



* through the [ODP portal](../Submissions/SubmitAPattern.md "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:SubmitAPattern") and
* by submitting a description of the pattern (pattern description) via [EasyChair]


Detailed instructions for patterns submission, including how to submit via the ontologydesignpatterns.org portal, are found at the  [submission page](../WOP/2014/Submission.md "WOP:2014/Submission"). Note that an account in the ODP portal is needed for submitting patterns; thus, authors should take care to request an account at least one week before their intended submission.


Pattern submissions can be made in any type of ODPs. Currently, portal templates for submission are provided for the following types of patterns (see general [typology](../OPTypes.md "OPTypes") for explanation of the types):



* Content patterns
* Structural patterns: logical and architecture patterns.
* Correspondence patterns: re-engineering and alignment patterns.


For other types of patterns, the author is welcome to submit only a pattern description.


  




##   Submission and Important Dates


For details on how to submit to WOP2014 see the  [submission page](../WOP/2014/Submission.md "WOP:2014/Submission"). 


__Important dates__



* Submission date (research papers and patterns): __16 July, 2014__  __(UPDATED DEADLINE)__
* Author notifications: __August 11, 2014__
* Camera-ready proceedings: __August 25, 2014__
* Workshops will be held on __October 19, 2014__


###   Fast-track submission to the Semantic Web journal


This year's workshop on ontology and semantic web patterns will offer a fast-track submission of selected papers to the [Semantic Web](http://semantic-web-journal.net "http://semantic-web-journal.net") journal's [special issue on ontology design patterns](http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/blog/special-call-ontology-design-pattern-descriptions "http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/blog/special-call-ontology-design-pattern-descriptions"). Authors of the best papers will be invited to submit a revised and extended version of their work to the journal. While fast-tracked papers will still undergo a full open and transparent review, they will be considered as _acceptable_ by the journal. Please note that we will make the selection of papers based on how suitable they are for such an extended submission and that such papers may still get rejected by the journal, e.g., if the authors fail to address the issues pointed out during review. Please contact Krzysztof if you have further questions, e.g., on the suitability of a paper.


__Results__


Based on the reviewer scores, the organization committee has decided to invite two papers (designated with an asterix in the list of accepted papers above) to this fast-track. To ensure objectivity, this decision was verified with members of the steering committee. The invited authors have been contacted.



###   Best Poster Award


Workshop participants will be able to vote for the best poster, final decision to be made by the chairs. The best poster award takes into account criteria such as the quality of the submission, the relevance and significance of patterns or pattern usages presented, the presentation of the poster during the "lightning talks", and the level of involvement of the author during the revision phase and poster session discussions during the workshop.


__The best poster award has been won by Ontology Patterns for Clinical Information Modelling as presented by Catalina Martínez-Costa__ We congratulate Catalina and her co-authors Daniel Karlsson and Stefan Schulz with this award. The poster is shown below.
