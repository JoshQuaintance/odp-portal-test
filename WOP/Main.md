##   Workshop Focus and Relevance


As interest in the Semantic Web increases and technologies for realizing the semantic web become more mature, the need for high-quality and reusable semantic web ontologies increases. To address the quality and reusability issues, different types of Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) have emerged. Patterns can supply ontology designers with several kinds of benefits, including a direct link to requirements, reuse, guidance, and better communication. ODPs are well on their way to providing those benefits. ODPs have been [proposed by the W3C](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/OEP/ "http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/OEP/") and are currently being collected in various repositories, such as the [catalogue maintained by the University of Manchester](http://www.gong.manchester.ac.uk/odp/html/index.html "http://www.gong.manchester.ac.uk/odp/html/index.html") and the ODP portal at [ontologydesignpatterns.org](../Ontology_Design_Patterns_._org_(ODP).md).html "Ontology Design Patterns . org (ODP)"). However, pattern catalogues are still small and do not cover all types of patterns and all domains. Semantic Web applications could also benefit from additional types of patterns, such as knowledge patterns and specialized software patterns for semantic applications. In addition, to achieve communication benefits, patterns need to be shared by a community in order to provide a common language for discussing and understanding modeling problems. These workshops can leverage the activities conducted in the ontologydesignpatterns.org initiative, and aims to use the portal as their main means of communication, e.g. for pattern submission, reviewing and discussions outside the workshop schedule.


Reuse has been an important research subject in ontology engineering for many years, and this is also true for the semantic web community. Patterns are an approach to knowledge reuse that has proved feasible and very profitable in many other areas such as software engineering and data modeling. During the past few years, patterns for semantic web ontologies and ontology-based applications have been introduced, e.g. a complete session of ISWC2011 was devoted to ontologies and patterns. An earlier workshop, [Ontology Patterns for the Semantic Web](http://www.research.ibm.com/people/w/welty/OPSW-05/ "http://www.research.ibm.com/people/w/welty/OPSW-05/") , was arranged at ISWC2005, however at that time the community was considerably smaller. The focus then was on discussing reusable OWL and RDF ontologies addressing general open problems. The WOP series broadens this scope to include all patterns related to ontology design and knowledge engineering for the Semantic Web. This is in line with the successful [EKAW2008](http://ekaw2008.inrialpes.fr/ "http://ekaw2008.inrialpes.fr/") conference (with the sub-title Knowledge Patterns). Topics of this conference included ontology engineering patterns but also patterns for re-engineering of knowledge resources, process knowledge, social and cognitive aspects of semantics. The first workshop was held in conjunction with ISWC 2009, a second edition at ISWC 2010, a third edition at ISWC2012, a fourth edition at ISWC2013, and a fifth edition is to be held at ISWC2014 in Riva del Garda (see links below).
