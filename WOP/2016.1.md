##   Workshop on Ontology and Semantic Web Patterns (7th edition) - WOP2016


This is the seventh edition in a series of workshops addressing the topic of __ontology and semantic web patterns as best practices__, related to the [_ontologydesignpatterns.org_](../Ontology_Design_Patterns_._org_(ODP).md).html "Ontology Design Patterns . org (ODP)") initiative. 


This workshop is a gathering point for the ontology design pattern community for semantic web and linked data. As interest in the Semantic Web increases and technologies for realizing the Semantic Web become more mature, the need for high-quality and reusable Semantic Web ontologies increases as well. To address the quality and reusability issues, different types of Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) have emerged, and methods for devising or discovering new ones from heterogeneous knowledge sources are needed.


Patterns need to be shared by a community in order to provide a common language, and to stimulate pattern usage and development. Hence, the aim of this workshop is twofold 



* providing an arena for proposing and discussing good practices, patterns, pattern-based ontologies, systems etc., and
* broadening the pattern community that is developing its own “language” for discussing and describing relevant problems and their solutions.


For more background on the workshop series, see the  [main page](../WOP/Main.md "WOP:Main").


WOP2016 is planned to be a _full-day workshop_ consisting of two parts: paper presentations and posters. The poster session will feature pattern posters, i.e. presentations of patterns submitted according the  [call for patterns](../WOP/2016.1.md#Call_for_Patterns "WOP:2016"). 



  




##   Venue and dates

__Title: Diverging Views of SHACL__


[slides](../images/6/65/WOP2016_keynote-ppfs.pdf "WOP2016 keynote-ppfs.pdf")


Abstract:


SHACL is a new recommendation being developed by the W3C Data Shapes Working
Group. SHACL is designed to address the need for a declarative language to
validate or describe the contents of an RDF graph. This amounts roughly to
checking whether an RDF graph satisfies a set of constraints. However,
there are several diverging views of just how RDF graph validation should
work, what kinds of constraints are needed for it, and how they should
interact. This led to some difficult discussions in the working group. I
will discuss these diverging views and how the current definition of SHACL
matches against them.

__Title: Patterns in the deep__


Abstract:


The Semantic Web is shifting towards data science and inductive techniques. This poses new opportunities and challenges to a science of knowledge patterns. On one hand, our vision from seven years ago is taking momentum, on the other hand, our community is not yet at the core of the unified efforts in hybridising arbitrary inferencing approaches towards artificial intelligences.
I will present some results obtained in the last years, and ideas on how to inject more knowledge patterns into the current apparently disordered scenario.

##   Call for Papers - Topics


Submission instruction for research papers (including position papers) can be found at the  [submission page](../WOP/2016/Submission.md "WOP:2016/Submission").


The main aim of the workshop is to discuss and collect solutions to recurrent problems that matter to researchers and practitioners of the Semantic Web field, and that impact on design and engineering of ontologies, linked data, knowledge extraction, and other semantic web applications. We invite the submission of original research results related to the focus areas of the workshop. _Research papers_ (maximum 12 pages LNCS style) should present mature work and document established results, or be _short papers_ presenting proposed research directions, novel ideas, or more general positions or discussions (maximum 5 pages LNCS style).


This year we particularly welcome papers which evaluate the current practice of ontology modeling.


Original research papers and short papers are invited to consider the following (non exhaustive) list of topics:



* Ontology design patterns (ODPs) and pattern-based ontologies
* Ontology patterns and their relation with standards
* Correspondence patterns for ontology matching and integration
* Knowledge patterns and knowledge reengineering based on patterns
* Processes and services process patterns
* Antipatterns and their relations to ODPs
* Pattern-based ontology design
* Tools and applications for pattern-based knowledge engineering
* Pattern-based methods and methodologies for development of semantic applications
* Ontology pattern extraction
* Pattern-based information extraction
* Pattern-based ontology learning
* Pattern-based ontology evaluation and selection
* Patterns and Linked data (usage, emerging patterns, pattern-driven data publishing, etc.)
* Analysis of ontology pattern usage
* Data mining patterns and Semantic Web design
* Web semantics from a pattern perspective
* Reasoning with or using patterns
* Relation between NLP patterns (either for learning, or procedural) and ontologies/linked data design
* Usage of patterns in business intelligence and conceptual modeling
* Patterns in semantic social networks, semantic wikis, semantic blogs
* ODPs development and use in specific domains including geosciences, life sciences, digital humanities, cultural heritage, e-history, etc.


##   Call for Patterns


Submission instruction can be found at the  [submission page](../WOP/2016/Submission.md "WOP:2016/Submission").


We invite the submission of research results in the form of ontology design patterns (ODPs). 
Patterns submitted should have a general relevance to the ontology engineering field, or specific interest within a knowledge domain. Patterns should solve some particular modeling problem, and be of significant interest for discussion at the workshop. Patterns should be original, in the sense that they are the intellectual product of the author(s), however they may still be based on the collective experience of a community.


Pattern submissions for the pattern session will be collected:



* through the [ODP portal](../Submissions/SubmitAPattern.md "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:SubmitAPattern") and
* by submitting a description of the pattern (pattern description) via EasyChair.


Detailed instructions for patterns submission, including how to submit via the ontologydesignpatterns.org portal, are found at the  [submission page](../WOP/2016/Submission.md "WOP:2016/Submission"). Note that an account in the ODP portal is needed for submitting patterns; thus, authors should take care to request an account at least one week before their intended submission.


Pattern submissions can be made in any type of ODPs. Currently, portal templates for submission are provided for the following types of patterns (see general [typology](../OPTypes.md "OPTypes") for explanation of the types):



* Content patterns
* Structural patterns: logical and architecture patterns.
* Correspondence patterns: re-engineering and alignment patterns.


For other types of patterns, the author is welcome to submit only a pattern description.



##   Submission and Important Dates


For details on how to submit to WOP2016 see the  [submission page](../WOP/2016/Submission.md "WOP:2016/Submission"). 


__Important dates__



* Abstract submission (required): June 24th, 2016 __extended to July 7th, 2016__
* Submission date: June 30th, 2016 __extended to July 15th, 2016__
* Author notifications: July 31th, 2016
* Camera-ready papers: August 26th, 2016
* Workshops will be held on: 17th or 18th October, 2016 (TBD)


  




###   Best Poster Award


The best poster award for WOP 2016 is awarded based on voting by the workshop chairs (excluding those workshop chairs who themselves authored or co-authored a poster). The best poster award takes into account criteria such as the quality of the submission, the relevance and significance of patterns or pattern usages presented, the presentation of the poster during the "lightning talks", and the level of involvement of the author during the revision phase and poster session discussions during the workshop. In addition to everlasting glory and recognition, the winner(s) also receive a copy of the recently released [Ontology Engineering with Ontology Design Patterns: Foundations and Applications](http://www.iospress.nl/book/ontology-engineering-with-ontology-design-patterns-foundations-and-applications/ "http://www.iospress.nl/book/ontology-engineering-with-ontology-design-patterns-foundations-and-applications/")


__The Best Poster Award for WOP 2016 was awarded to _The Reporting Event Ontology Design Pattern_ by Ewa Kowalczuk and Agnieszka Lawrynowicz, presented at WOP by Ewa Kowalczuk. Congratulations Ewa and Agnieszka!__
