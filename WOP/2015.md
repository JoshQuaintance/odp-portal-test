##   Workshop on Ontology and Semantic Web Patterns (6th edition) - WOP2015


This is the sixth edition in a series of workshops addressing the topic of __ontology and semantic web patterns as best practices__, related to the [_ontologydesignpatterns.org_](../Ontology_Design_Patterns_._org_(ODP)).md).md).html "Ontology Design Patterns . org (ODP)") initiative. 


This workshop is a gatherig point for the ontology design pattern community for semantic web and linked data. As interest in the Semantic Web increases and technologies for realizing the Semantic Web become more mature, the need for high-quality and reusable Semantic Web ontologies increases as well. To address the quality and reusability issues, different types of Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) have emerged, and methods for devising or discovering new ones from heterogeneous knowledge sources are needed.


Patterns need to be shared by a community in order to provide a common language, and to stimulate pattern usage and development. Hence, the aim of this workshop is twofold 



* providing an arena for proposing and discussing good practices, patterns, pattern-based ontologies, systems etc., and
* broadening the pattern community that is developing its own “language” for discussing and describing relevant problems and their solutions.


For more background on the workshop series, see the  [main page](../WOP/Main "WOP:Main").


WOP2015 will be a _full-day workshop_ consisting of two parts: paper presentations and posters. The poster session will feature pattern posters, i.e. presentations of patterns submitted according the  [call for patterns](../WOP/2015#Call_for_Patterns "WOP:2015"). 



  




##   Venue and dates


The sixth edition of WOP will be held as a full-day workshop on 11th October 2015, in conjunction with [ISWC 2015](http://iswc2015.semanticweb.org/ "http://iswc2015.semanticweb.org/"). 



###   Social Dinner

__Title:__ Ontology Engineering: A View from the Trenches


__Abstract:__ Starting from an experience report on developing ontologies and ontology design patterns for a variety of domains and purposes, this talk will reflect on the complex relationship between Linked Data, cyberinfrastructure, and ontologies. I will discuss the role of modularization and patterns for ontology engineering, technical and social challenges in the adoption of the developed ontologies, and common misunderstandings about interoperability and semantic heterogeneity. Based on this overview, I will outline three new perspectives and argue how they can address some of the outlined challenges.


__Bio:__ Krzysztof Janowicz is an Associate Professor for Geographic Information Science and Geoinformatics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, USA. He is the program chair of UCSB's Cognitive Science Program, one of two Editors-in-Chief of the Semantic Web journal, and a Faculty Research Affiliate of the Center for Information Technology and Society. Finally, he is running the STKO Lab which investigates the role of space and time for knowledge organization.

##   Call for Papers - Topics


Submission instruction for research papers (including position papers) can be found at the  [submission page](../WOP/2015/Submission "WOP:2015/Submission").


The main aim of the workshop is to discuss and collect solutions to recurrent problems that matter to researchers and practitioners of the Semantic Web field, and that impact on design and engineering of ontologies, linked data, knowledge extraction, and other semantic web applications. We invite the submission of original research results related to the focus areas of the workshop. _Research papers_ (maximum 12 pages LNCS style) should present mature work and document established results, or be _short papers_ presenting proposed research directions and novel ideas (maximum 4 pages LNCS style).


This year we particularly welcome contributions of patterns concerning Linked Data, as well as
patterns geared towards applications in specific domains, such as geosciences, biomedical sciences,
as well as digital humanities.


Original research papers and short papers are invited to consider the following (non exhaustive) list of topics:



* Ontology design patterns (ODPs) and pattern-based ontology design
* Anti-patterns and their relations to ODPs
* Pattern-based ontologies
* Ontology patterns and their relation with standards
* Ontology pattern extraction
* Analysis of ontology pattern usage
* Pattern-based ontology evaluation and selection
* Correspondence patterns for ontology matching and integration
* Best practices and examples for using existing ontologies/datasets to instantiate ODPs

##   Call for Patterns


Submission instruction can be found at the  [submission page](../WOP/2015/Submission "WOP:2015/Submission").


We invite the submission of research results in the form of ontology design patterns (ODPs). 
Patterns submitted should have a general relevance to the ontology engineering field, or specific interest within a knowledge domain. Patterns should solve some particular modeling problem, and be of significant interest for discussion at the workshop. Patterns should be original, in the sense that they are the intellectual product of the author(s), however they may still be based on the collective experience of a community.


Pattern submissions for the pattern session will be collected:



* through the [ODP portal](../Submissions/SubmitAPattern "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:SubmitAPattern") and
* by submitting a description of the pattern (pattern description) via EasyChair.


Detailed instructions for patterns submission, including how to submit via the ontologydesignpatterns.org portal, are found at the  [submission page](../WOP/2015/Submission "WOP:2015/Submission"). Note that an account in the ODP portal is needed for submitting patterns; thus, authors should take care to request an account at least one week before their intended submission.


Pattern submissions can be made in any type of ODPs. Currently, portal templates for submission are provided for the following types of patterns (see general [typology](../OPTypes "OPTypes") for explanation of the types):



* Content patterns
* Structural patterns: logical and architecture patterns.
* Correspondence patterns: re-engineering and alignment patterns.


For other types of patterns, the author is welcome to submit only a pattern description.



##   Submission and Important Dates


For details on how to submit to WOP2015 see the  [submission page](../WOP/2015/Submission "WOP:2015/Submission"). 


__Important dates__



* Abstract submission (required): July 1, 2015
* Submission date: July 7, 2015 (extended!)
* Author notifications: July 30, 2015
* Camera-ready papers: to be determined
* Workshops will be held on to be determined


  




###   Best Poster Award


Workshop participants will be able to vote for the best poster, final decision to be made by the chairs. The best poster award takes into account criteria such as the quality of the submission, the relevance and significance of patterns or pattern usages presented, the presentation of the poster during the "lightning talks", and the level of involvement of the author during the revision phase and poster session discussions during the workshop.



##  Proceedings


Accepted research papers and pattern descriptions were published online as CEUR-Workshop Proceedings, and are available from [http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1461/](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1461/ "http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1461/").
