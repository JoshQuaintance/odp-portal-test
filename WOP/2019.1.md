#   10th Workshop on Ontology Design and Patterns - WOP2019


This is the tenth edition in a series of workshops addressing the topic of __ontology and semantic web patterns as best practices__, related to the [_ontologydesignpatterns.org_](../Ontology_Design_Patterns_._org_(ODP).md).html "Ontology Design Patterns . org (ODP)") initiative.


The workshop series covers issues related to quality in ontology design and ontology design patterns (ODPs) for data and knowledge engineering in Semantic Web. The increased attention to ODPs in recent years through their interaction with emerging trends of Semantic Web such as knowledge graphs can be attributed to their benefit for knowledge engineers and Semantic Web developers. Such benefits come in the form of direct link to requirements, reuse, guidance, and better communication. The workshop’s aim is thus not just: 1) providing an arena for discussing patterns, pattern-based ontologies, systems, datasets, but also 2) broadening the pattern community by developing its own "discourse" for discussing and describing relevant problems and their solutions.


For more background on the workshop series, see the  [main page](../WOP/Main.md "WOP:Main").


WOP2019 is a _full-day workshop_ consisting of three parts: paper presentations, a poster session, and an interactive breakout discussion session.

##   Keynote


__Categories are in flux, but their computational representations are static and isolated. That’s a problem__
by Mark Gahegan, School of Computer Science and Centre for eResearch, The University of Auckland


__Abstract:__ Whether we are creating categories of our own, or operationalising categories proposed by somebody else, how we do it, and how well we do it are seldom recorded. It is therefore usually impossible for another researcher to fully understand how a category came to be, or what it meant to its creator(s). This makes our science opaque and harder for others to reuse. When we create and modify categories, our computational systems are not up to the task of representing how they came into being and how they have changed over time, we have falsely separated our ontological representations from the process of analysis. But they should be tightly coupled to it! Consequently, ontologies only capture part of this meaning: they describe what we would like our categories to mean, not how exactly they came to be, nor why they ended up the way they are, nor what they evolved from, or later became. But much of their identity and meaning is unfortunately tied up with the process of their construction and use. The issue pervades all fields of enquiry where we rely on the human construction of categories to help us understand the world and communicate this understanding with others. 


This talk describes our efforts to represent concepts/categories & relationships (via ontologies), data, analytical methods and workflow all _within the a single computational environment_, allowing us to explicitly describe the interplay between these research artefacts and how they each shape meaning. It also allows us to keep track of how changes to any one artefact can affect others. For example, improving a classifier might lead to changes in categorical (intensional) models, but might not change the related ontology.
