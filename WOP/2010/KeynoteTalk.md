###   Abstract


Ontology Patterns for the semantic web are closest in spirit to software patterns, e.g. [Gamma, et al, 1997]. They are, or should be, motivated by design experience, not philosophical tradition. The software pattern community was launched into prominence as the result of an effort in "software archeology": digging through existing software, observing and cataloging different solution methods, generalizing and classifying them in a sensible framework, and publishing the result. In this talk I will argue for an archeological and less theoretical approach to ontology patterns, with examples.
