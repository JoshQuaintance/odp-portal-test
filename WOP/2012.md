##   Welcome to the 3rd Workshop on Ontology Patterns - WOP2012


This workshop is partly supported by the [IKS EU co-funded project](http://www.iks-project.eu/ "http://www.iks-project.eu/"). 


This is the third edition in a series of workshops addressing the emerging topic of __ontology patterns as best practices__, related to the [_ontologydesignpatterns.org_](../Ontology_Design_Patterns_._org_(ODP)).md).md).html "Ontology Design Patterns . org (ODP)") initiative. 


Patterns need to be shared by a community in order to provide a common language, and to stimulate pattern usage and development. Hence, the aim of this workshop is twofold 



* providing an arena for proposing and discussing good practices, patterns, pattern-based ontologies, systems etc., and
* broadening the pattern community that is developing its own “language” for discussing and describing relevant problems and their solutions.


For more background on the workshop series, see the  [main page](../WOP/Main "WOP:Main").


WOP2012 will be a half-day workshop consisting of two parts: paper presentations and posters. The poster session will feature pattern posters, i.e. presentations of patterns submitted according the  [call for patterns](../WOP/2012#Call_for_Patterns "WOP:2012").

####  Presenter instructions


Paper presentations of 15 minutes each (+ 5-10 min discussion). Lightning talks (mandatory) for presenting the posters (both paper and patterns) of maximum 2 minutes each (= max 2 slides) in a specific session preceding the poster session. All posters must be placed on the stands before 08:30, and left on the stands until 12:40 - lightning talk slides have to be entered on a dedicated USB-stick before 09:55.



####   Best Poster Award


Workshop participants will be able to vote for the best poster, final decision to be made by the chairs. The best poster award takes into account criteria such as the quality of the submission, the relevance and significance of patterns or pattern usages presented, the presentation of the poster during the "lightning talks", and the level of involvement of the author during the revision phase and poster session discussions during the workshop.



##  Proceedings


Accepted research papers and pattern descriptions are published online as CEUR-Workshop Proceedings, [Volume 929](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-929 "http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-929").



##   Call for Papers - Topics


Submission instruction for research papers (including position papers) can be found at the  [submission page](../WOP/2012/Submission "WOP:2012/Submission").


The main aim of the workshop is to discuss and collect solutions to recurrent problems i.e. ontology patterns, that matter to researchers and practitioners of the Semantic Web field, and that impact on ontology design and engineering. Original research papers and poster papers are invited to consider the following (non exhaustive) list of topics:



* Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) and pattern-based ontology design
* ODPs for specific knowledge domains e.g. multimedia, fishery and agriculture, user profiling, business modeling, etc.
* Anti-patterns and their relations to ODPs
* ODPs for interacting with data
* ODPs for expressing relevance of data in context
* Collaborative ontology design and collaboration patterns in ontology design and engineering
* Correspondence patterns for ontology matching and integration
* Lexico-syntactic patterns
* Reasoning patterns (workflows made of reasoning steps for addressing specific goals)
* Processes and services - process patterns
* Re-engineering patterns for conceptual models, folksonomies, lexicons, thesauri
* Problem solving methods and patterns


  




* Ontology Design Patterns and Linked Data
* Ontology Patterns and Microformats
* Patterns for using different vocabularies together e.g. FOAF, SIOC, DC, etc.
* Web semantics from a pattern perspective


  




* Good practices of ontology design
* Good practices for Linked Data and related applications
* Good practices for hybridization of semantic web and NLP techniques
* Good Practices and Patterns of semantic social networks, semantic wikis, semantic blogs
* Good Practices of Semantic Web in general


  




* Software patterns for Semantic Web applications
* Interaction patterns and the Semantic Web
* Pattern-based methodologies for Semantic Web ontologies and software engineering
* Application Profiles
* Domain specific applications based on patterns and success-stories
* Pattern-based ontologies


  




* Tools support for pattern-based knowledge engineering
* Pattern-based ontology evaluation and selection
* Automatic ontology construction (ontology learning) based on patterns
* Contextual reasoning and patterns as context
* Knowledge patterns and knowledge re-engineering based on patterns
* Pattern-based information extraction


  




* Quality evaluation of patterns
* Benefits of ontology patterns and knowledge patterns


##   Call for Patterns


We invite the submission of research results in the form of ontology design patterns (ODPs). 
Patterns submitted should have a general relevance to the ontology engineering field, or specific interest within a knowledge domain. Patterns should solve some particular problem, and be of significant interest for discussion at the workshop. Patterns should be original, in the sense that they are the intellectual product of the author(s), however they may still be based on the collective experience of a community.


Pattern submissions for the pattern session will be collected:



* through the [ODP portal](../Submissions/SubmitAPattern "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:SubmitAPattern") and
* by submitting a description of the pattern (pattern description) via [EasyChair](https://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=wop2012 "https://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=wop2012")


Detailed instructions for patterns submission, including how to submit via the ontologydesignpatterns.org portal, are found at the  [submission page](../WOP/2012/Submission "WOP:2012/Submission"). Note that an account in the ODP portal is needed for submitting patterns; thus, authors should take care to request an account at least one week before their intended submission.


Pattern submissions can be made in any type of ODPs. Currently, portal templates for submission are provided for the following types of patterns (see general [typology](../OPTypes "OPTypes") for explanation of the types):



* Content patterns
* Structural patterns: logical and architecture patterns.
* Correspondence patterns: re-engineering and alignment patterns.


For other types of patterns, the author is welcome to submit only a pattern description.
