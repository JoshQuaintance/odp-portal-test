#   13th Workshop on Ontology Design and Patterns - WOP2022


This is the thirteenth edition in a series of workshops addressing the topic of __ontology and semantic web patterns as best practices__, related to the [_ontologydesignpatterns.org_](/wiki/Ontology_Design_Patterns_._org_%28ODP%29 "Ontology Design Patterns . org (ODP)") initiative.


The workshop series covers issues related to quality in ontology design and ontology design patterns (ODPs) for data and knowledge engineering in Semantic Web. The increased attention to ODPs in recent years through their interaction with emerging trends of Semantic Web such as knowledge graphs can be attributed to their benefit for knowledge engineers and Semantic Web developers. Such benefits come in the form of a direct link to requirements, reuse, guidance, and better communication. The workshop’s aim is thus not just: 1) providing an arena for discussing patterns, pattern-based ontologies, systems, datasets, but also 2) broadening the pattern community by developing its own "discourse" for discussing and describing relevant problems and their solutions.


For more background on the workshop series, see the  [main page](/wiki/WOP:Main "WOP:Main").


WOP2022 is a _full-day workshop_ consisting of three parts: keynote presentation, paper presentation session, and an interactive Q&A discussion session.



  




#   Venue and dates


The thirteenth edition of WOP was held in conjunction with [ISWC 2022](http://iswc2022.semanticweb.org "http://iswc2022.semanticweb.org") in Hangzhou, China.
WOP 2022 is a \*\* hybrid \*\* workshop this year.

#   Call for Papers and Patterns


We invite the submission of original research results related to the focus areas of the workshop, in one of three categories:



1. Research papers (maximum 12 pages CEUR style) presenting mature work and established results.
2. Short papers (maximum 6 pages CEUR style) presenting proposed research directions, novel ideas, or more general positions or discussions.
3. Ontology Design Patterns (described in paper format, 5-12 pages CEUR style) should solve a particular modeling problem, of relevance either to the broader ontology engineering community or to some specific knowledge domain, in a novel and reusable manner. These must additionally be submitted through the ODP community portal. Note that accepted pattern submissions are presented through a poster session (see below).


##   Topics of interest


Topics include but are not limited to:



1. Use of ontology design patterns for any kind of knowledge engineering, including

	* Pattern-based ontology design, conceptual modeling or knowledge engineering broadly
	* Pattern Use in knowledge graphs or linked data settings (including pattern-driven linking or data publishing)
	* Pattern-based information extraction, ontology learning, and relation to NLP
	* Pattern use in streaming, ingesting or evolving knowledge
	* Use of patterns for ontology evaluation, quality assurance, ontology selection, integration or alignment
	* Pattern-based development of semantic applications
	* Reasoning with patterns (including automated reasoning, verification, or contextual reasoning)
2. Methods and tools for developing high-quality ontologies (with or without the help of patterns), including

	* Ontology engineering by domain experts
	* Quality attributes or metrics in ontologies and ontology engineering
	* Quality assurance approaches for ontology engineering
3. Development or analysis of ontology design patterns, including

	* Pattern extraction
	* Analyses of ontology design patterns or their uses
	* Antipatterns and their relations to ODPs
4. Development and use of patterns in specific domains, including

	* Data lakes, business intelligence, or Big Data integration
	* Geosciences, life sciences, engineering, digital humanities, cultural preservation
	* IoT, smart homes & cities, smart agriculture
	* Semantic technology including social networks, semantic wikis or blogs


##   Submitting


Submissions should be made via the [WOP 2022 EasyChair page](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wop2022 "https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wop2022"). Detailed instructions can be found at [the submission page](/wiki/WOP:2022/Submission "WOP:2022/Submission"). Note that design pattern submissions also need to be submitted to the ontologydesignpatterns.org community portal, as described on that page.



##   Posters


Accepted pattern submissions will be expected to present a poster describing the pattern at the workshop poster session. 


Accepted research or short papers may also be presented in this manner if the authors would like to, but posters are not mandatory for such submissions.



##   Important Dates


* Papers submissions: July 12, 2022
* Papers notifications: August 3, 2022
* Camera-ready submissions: September 2, 2022
* Workshop will be held on: October 23 or 24, 2022


#   Proceedings


Accepted research papers and pattern descriptions will be published online as CEUR-Workshop Proceedings.
