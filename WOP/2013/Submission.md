__Review process and publication__


Each paper will be reviewed by at least three reviewers, final accept/reject decisions are made by the chairs based on these reviews. Notification of acceptance will be sent out by August 9th. Acceptance is conditional, meaning that only accepted papers that perform the changes requested by the reviewers (will be checked carefully by the chairs) and submit their camera ready version by August 31st, and where at least one author registers for the workshop, will be included in the proceedings and in the workshop program. Please note that ISWC usually do NOT allow "workshop-only" registrations, i.e. registering for the workshop will therefore mean to register for the main conference + WOP.


Instructions for accepted papers and presentations will be provided later.



##   Pattern Submissions


####   Submitting your pattern


* [Request an account at the ODP portal](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Special:RequestAccount "Special:RequestAccount"), in case you do not have already one. Note that account requests are processed by hand, so do this step with a few days to spare before the submission deadline.
* Go to the ODP portal  [pattern submission page](../../Submissions/SubmitAPattern "Submissions:SubmitAPattern").
* Submit your pattern by following the instructions, and make sure you enter as much information about your pattern as possible (clarity and completeness of the information will be a review criteria for patterns), i.e. fill out __all__ applicable fields.
* Once created, edit your pattern page (edit tab at the top of the page) and under the "Submit for event" tab enter "WOP:2013".
* Go back to  [this page](../../index.php@title=Odp/Add_reference&subject=Submissions/Lexico+Syntactic+ODPs+corresponding+to+Simple+Part-Whole+relation+&quot;or&quot;+Constituency+&quot;or&quot;+Componency+&quot;or&quot;+Collection-Entity+ODPs.md#Pattern_Submissions "WOP:2013/Submission") and check that your pattern appears in the table below.
* Write a document briefly describing your pattern (maximum __4 pages__ in LNCS style), and submit this pattern description through [EasyChair](https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wop2013 "https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wop2013") (Patterns Track). Both pattern and pattern description need to be submitted by July 12th at 11:59pm (Hawaii time).
* If you are experiencing any problems, or have questions about how to submit patterns, please contact [Ansgar Scherp](http://ansgarscherp.net/ "http://ansgarscherp.net/") and [Laurent Lefort](http://www.ict.csiro.au/staff/laurent.lefort/ "http://www.ict.csiro.au/staff/laurent.lefort/").


####   Review Process


Each submission will be reviewed by at least two members of the Pattern PC (in case of disagreement a third reviewer will be assigned). Note that all reviews and discussions of patterns done in  [ODP portal](../../Ontology_Design_Patterns_._org_(ODP)).md).md).html "Ontology Design Patterns . org (ODP)") are __public__ and __not__ anonymous, hence, all visitors of the portal can see the reviews and any subsequent discussion. Your pattern will be reviewed based on the following set of criteria:



* the practical utility and reusability of the pattern by a community,
* the relevance of the problem addressed by the pattern,
* if the pattern encodes some best practice within a community,
* and the completeness and clarity of the pattern submission, i.e., if all fields have been filled and all aspects properly explained.


Accepted patterns have to be improved based on the review comments, i.e., an update of the patterns in the ODP portal is mandatory. Accepted patterns will be presented at the workshop as posters in the pattern session. After the workshop, the patterns may be considered for certification in the ODP portal.



####   Attending WOP


At least one author of each pattern accepted in WOP2013 must register for the workshop and attend the workshop pattern session to present the pattern. 
Further instructions on poster size and other practical details will follow after the selection has been finalized. 
In the case of acceptance of both a pattern and a research paper describing the same pattern, only one registration is necessary but it is expected that you prepare both an oral presentation and a poster.
