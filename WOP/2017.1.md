##   __8th Workshop on Ontology Design and Patterns - WOP2017__



__Saturday 21st October 2017, Vienna, Austria – Collocated with ISWC 2017__


__Venue:__ WOP 2017 will take place in [Room TC.2.01](https://campus.wu.ac.at/en/?campus=1&q=TC.2.01#map "https://campus.wu.ac.at/en/?campus=1&q=TC.2.01#map") on the WU Campus.




This is the eight edition in a series of workshops addressing the topic of __ontology and semantic web patterns as best practices__, related to the [_ontologydesignpatterns.org_](../Ontology_Design_Patterns_._org_(ODP).md).html "Ontology Design Patterns . org (ODP)") initiative. 


The Workshop on Ontology Design and Patterns targets topics relating to high quality ontology design. The workshop series addresses topics centered around quality in ontology design as well as ontology design patterns (ODP) in Semantic Web data and ontology engineering. ODPs have seen a sharp rise in attention in the past few years, both pertaining to this workshop series and other related events. Patterns can benefit knowledge engineers and Semantic Web developers with a direct link to requirements, reuse, guidance, and better communication. They need to be shared by a community in order to provide a common language, hence the aim of this workshop is twofold: 1) providing an arena for discussing patterns, pattern-based ontologies, systems, datasets, etc., and 2) broadening the pattern community by developing its own 'discourse' for discussing and describing relevant problems and their solutions. Related to the latter aim we see that it is an opportune time to open up the workshop to other approaches focusing on high quality ontology design, e.g. other methods and tools, with the intention to cross-fertilise these with the ODP idea.


For more background on the workshop series, see the  [main page](../WOP/Main.md "WOP:Main").


WOP2017 is a _full-day workshop_ consisting of three parts: paper presentations, pattern presentations and posters, and an interactive pattern writing and/or discussion session. The poster session will feature pattern posters, i.e. presentations of patterns submitted according the  [call for patterns](../WOP/2017.1.md#Call_for_Patterns "WOP:2017"). 



  




##   Venue and dates


The eight edition of WOP will be held in conjunction with [ISWC 2017](http://iswc2017.semanticweb.org "http://iswc2017.semanticweb.org") in Vienna, Austria on 21st or 22nd of October 2017.

###  Session 1 (09:00 - 10:30)


__Welcome & Introduction__


  

Keynote Talk:  

__Ontology Modeling 2.0: Next Steps__  

by Pascal Hitzler




__Abstract:__ Advances in ontology-design-pattern (ODP) based ontology modeling have already led to solid drafts of modeling methodologies. At the same time, however, there is still a lack in suitable documentation, artefacts and tools which severely hinders the uptake of the approach.
In this presentation, we will point out the most severe gaps which the community needs to fill in order to enable a large-scale uptake of high-quality ODP-based ontology modeling. We also point out avenues for further research on the topic. 


__Presenter Bio__: Pascal Hitzler is endowed NCR Distinguished Professor and Director of Data Science at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, U.S.A.

##   Call for Papers - Topics


Submission of research papers (including position papers) is via the [WOP 2017 EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wop2017 "https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wop2017") page. Detailed submission instructions can be found on the  [WOP 2017 submission page](../WOP/2017/Submission.md "WOP:2017/Submission").


The main aim of the workshop is to discuss and collect solutions to recurrent problems that matter to researchers and practitioners of the Semantic Web field, and that impact on design and engineering of ontologies, linked data, knowledge extraction, and other semantic web applications. We invite the submission of original research results related to the focus areas of the workshop. __Research papers (maximum 15 pages LNCS style)__ should present mature work and document established results. __Short papers (maximum 5 pages LNCS style)__ may present proposed research directions, novel ideas, or more general positions or discussions.


__This year we particularly welcome contributions considering how one can develop high-quality ontologies in general, with or without the help of ODPs.__ Nevertheless, as usual we also welcome
pattern descriptions of all sorts, including patterns geared towards applications in specific domains,
such as geosciences, biomedical science, as well as digital humanities. The following shows main
topics of interest:



* Ontology design patterns, analyses of ODP use, and analyses of pattern-based ontologies
* Correspondence patterns for ontology matching and integration
* Knowledge patterns and knowledge reengineering based on patterns
* Antipatterns and their relations to ODPs
* Methods and tools for developing high-quality ontologies, including ontology engineering by domain experts \*new\*
* Analyses of quality attributes in ontologies and ontology engineering, and quality assurance approaches for ontology engineering \*new\*
* Pattern-based ontology design and knowledge engineering
* Pattern-based methods and methodologies for development of semantic applications
* Ontology pattern extraction
* Pattern-based information extraction, ontology learning, and relation to NLP
* Pattern-based ontology evaluation and selection
* Patterns and Linked data (usage, emerging patterns, pattern-driven data publishing, etc.)
* Quality assurance for Linked Data vocabularies \*new\*
* Patterns for streaming data and evolving knowledge, as well as processes and services
* Data mining patterns and Semantic Web design
* Web semantics from a pattern perspective
* Reasoning with, or using, patterns
* Patterns in semantic social networks, semantic wikis, semantic blogs, as well as in related fields such as business intelligence and conceptual modelling
* ODPs development and use in specific domains including geosciences, life sciences, digital humanities, cultural heritage, e-history, etc.


##   Call for Patterns


Submissions should be made via the [WOP 2017 Easy Chair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wop2017 "https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wop2017") page. Detailed instructions for submitting your pattern can be found at the  [WOP 2017 submission page](../WOP/2017/Submission.md "WOP:2017/Submission").


We invite the submission of research results in the form of ontology design patterns (ODPs). 
Patterns submitted should have a general relevance to the ontology engineering field, or specific interest within a knowledge domain. Patterns should solve some particular modelling problem, and be of significant interest for discussion at the workshop. Patterns should be original, in the sense that they are the intellectual product of the author(s), however they may still be based on the collective experience of a community.


Pattern submissions for the pattern session will be collected:



* through the [ODP portal](../Submissions/SubmitAPattern.md "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:SubmitAPattern") and
* by submitting a description of the pattern (pattern description) via EasyChair.


Detailed instructions for patterns submission, including how to submit via the ontologydesignpatterns.org portal, are found at the  [submission page](../WOP/2017/Submission.md "WOP:2017/Submission"). Note that an account in the ODP portal is needed for submitting patterns; thus, authors should take care to request an account at least one week before their intended submission.


Pattern submissions can be made in any type of ODPs. Currently, portal templates for submission are provided for the following types of patterns (see general [typology](../OPTypes.md "OPTypes") for explanation of the types):



* Content patterns
* Structural patterns: logical and architecture patterns.
* Correspondence patterns: re-engineering and alignment patterns.


For other types of patterns, the author is welcome to submit only a pattern description.



##   Submission and Important Dates


Submissions should be made via the [WOP 2017 Easy Chair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wop2017 "https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wop2017") page.
