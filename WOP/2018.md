#   9th Workshop on Ontology Design and Patterns - WOP2018


This is the ninth edition in a series of workshops addressing the topic of __ontology and semantic web patterns as best practices__, related to the [_ontologydesignpatterns.org_](/wiki/Ontology_Design_Patterns_._org_%28ODP%29 "Ontology Design Patterns . org (ODP)") initiative. 


The Workshop on Ontology Design and Patterns targets topics relating to high quality ontology design. The workshop series addresses topics centered around quality in ontology design as well as ontology design patterns (ODP) in Semantic Web data and ontology engineering. ODPs have seen a sharp rise in attention in the past few years, both pertaining to this workshop series and other related events. Patterns can benefit knowledge engineers and Semantic Web developers with a direct link to requirements, reuse, guidance, and better communication. They need to be shared by a community in order to provide a common language, hence the aim of this workshop is twofold: 1) providing an arena for discussing patterns, pattern-based ontologies, systems, datasets, etc., and 2) broadening the pattern community by developing its own 'discourse' for discussing and describing relevant problems and their solutions. Related to the latter aim we see that it is an opportune time to open up the workshop to other approaches focusing on high quality ontology design, e.g. other methods and tools, with the intention to cross-fertilise these with the ODP idea.


For more background on the workshop series, see the  [main page](/wiki/WOP:Main "WOP:Main").


WOP2018 is a _full-day workshop_ consisting of three parts: paper presentations, a poster session, and an interactive breakout discussion session..

__Ontological Modelling in Wikidata__
by Markus Kroetzsch


__Abstract:__ Wikidata, the knowledge base of Wikimedia, has been extremely successful in building and sustaining new communities of editors and users. Since its inception in 2012, it has developed from an experimental “data wiki” into a well-organised reference knowledge base with an amazing array of applications. Developing an ontological schema for such an open and rapidly expanding project is a huge undertaking, and difficult challenges arise on many levels. The community has directed significant efforts towards vocabulary development, many guidelines and rules have been created, and tools are used for helping editors to avoid and correct modelling errors. Nevertheless, the distributed nature of Wikidata editing often means that ontology design, too, is distributed, and a coherent global view is only being worked on once significant amounts of data have been added. The result is a knowledge graph with a widely varying modelling quality across different sub-domains.


The big question for researchers is how their insights and methods can help here. The Wikidata community is widely aware of semantic web activities and existing standards and academic publications play a role in many discussions. Yet, there seems to be only little direct exchange between the communities. In this talk, I will review the current state of Wikidata and its connection to semantic web standards such as RDF and SPARQL. I will try to raise awareness of the particular requirements of Wikidata, and argue that these are of general interest for the data-driven curation of knowledge graphs.


__Presenter Bio__: Markus is a full professor at the Faculty of Computer Science of the Technical University of Dresden, where he is holding the chair for Knowledge-Based Systems. He obtained his Ph.D. from the Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods (AIFB) of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in 2010, and thereafter worked as a researcher and departmental lecturer at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Oxford until October 2013. From November 2013 till his appointment as a professor in July 2016, he was leading an Emmy Noether research group at TU Dresden. Markus has made important contributions to the development of Wikipedia's free knowledge base Wikidata, the highly efficient ELK reasoner for OWL EL, to the popular semantic content management system Semantic MediaWiki, and to the widely used W3C OWL 2 standard. His research has contributed to the fields of lightweight and rule-based ontology languages, query answering, reasoning complexity, and content management and integration platforms for the Web of Data.

#   Call for Papers - Topics


Submission of research papers (including position papers) is via the [WOP 2018 EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wop2018 "https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wop2018") page. Detailed submission instructions can be found on the  [WOP 2018 submission page](/wiki/WOP:2018/Submission "WOP:2018/Submission").


The main aim of the workshop is to discuss and collect solutions to recurrent problems that matter to researchers and practitioners of the Semantic Web field, and that impact on design and engineering of ontologies, linked data, knowledge extraction, and other semantic web applications. We invite the submission of original research results related to the focus areas of the workshop. __Research papers (maximum 15 pages LNCS style)__ should present mature work and document established results. __Short papers (maximum 5 pages LNCS style)__ may present proposed research directions, novel ideas, or more general positions or discussions.


We particularly welcome contributions considering how one can develop high-quality ontologies in general, with or without the help of ODPs. Nevertheless, as usual we also welcome pattern descriptions of all sorts, including patterns geared towards applications in specific domains, such as geosciences, biomedical science, as well as digital humanities. The main topics of interest are:



* Ontology design patterns, analyses of ODP use, and analyses of pattern-based ontologies
* Correspondence patterns for ontology matching and integration
* Knowledge patterns and knowledge reengineering based on patterns
* Antipatterns and their relations to ODPs
* Methods and tools for developing high-quality ontologies, including ontology engineering by domain experts
* Analyses of quality attributes in ontologies and ontology engineering, and quality assurance approaches for ontology engineering
* Pattern-based ontology design and knowledge engineering
* Pattern-based ontology evaluation and selection
* Ontology pattern extraction
* Pattern-based information extraction, ontology learning, and relation to NLP
* Patterns and Linked data (usage, emerging patterns, pattern-driven data publishing, etc.)
* Quality assurance for Linked Data vocabularies
* Web semantics from a pattern perspective
* Reasoning with, or using, patterns
* Contextual reasoning and patterns as context
* Pattern-based methods and methodologies for development of semantic applications
* Patterns for streaming data and evolving knowledge, as well as processes and services
* Patterns for Big Data integration, data lakes, conceptual modeling, ontology-based data access, and business intelligence
* Patterns in semantic social networks, semantic wikis, semantic blogs
* ODPs development and use in specific domains including geosciences, life sciences, digital humanities, cultural heritage, e-history, IoT, smart homes & cities, smart agriculture etc.


#   Call for Patterns


Submissions should be made via the [WOP 2018 EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wop2018 "https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wop2018") page. Detailed instructions for submitting your pattern can be found at the  [WOP 2018 submission page](/wiki/WOP:2018/Submission "WOP:2018/Submission").


We invite the submission of research results in the form of ontology design patterns (ODPs). 
Patterns submitted should have a general relevance to the ontology engineering field, or specific interest within a knowledge domain. Patterns should solve some particular modelling problem, and be of significant interest for discussion at the workshop. Patterns should be original, in the sense that they are the intellectual product of the author(s), however they may still be based on the collective experience of a community.


Pattern submissions for the pattern session will be collected:



* through the [ODP portal](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:SubmitAPattern "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:SubmitAPattern") and
* by submitting a description of the pattern (pattern description) via EasyChair.


Detailed instructions for patterns submission, including how to submit via the ontologydesignpatterns.org portal, are found at the  [submission page](/wiki/WOP:2018/Submission "WOP:2018/Submission"). Note that an account in the ODP portal is needed for submitting patterns; thus, authors should take care to request an account at least one week before their intended submission.


Pattern submissions can be made in any type of ODPs. Currently, portal templates for submission are provided for the following types of patterns (see general [typology](/wiki/OPTypes "OPTypes") for explanation of the types):



* Content patterns
* Structural patterns: logical and architecture patterns.
* Correspondence patterns: re-engineering and alignment patterns.


For other types of patterns, the author is welcome to submit only a pattern description.

Detailed submission requirements can be found on the  [WOP 2018 submission page](/wiki/WOP:2018/Submission "WOP:2018/Submission").



##   Important dates


* Abstract submission (required): June 5th, 2018
* Submission date: June 11th, 2018
* Author notifications: June 27th, 2018
* Camera-ready papers: July 20th, 2018
* Workshop will be held on: October 9th, 2018


##   Best Poster Award


The best poster award for WOP 2018 is awarded based on voting by the workshop chairs (excluding those workshop chairs who themselves authored or co-authored a poster). The best poster award takes into account criteria such as the quality of the submission, the relevance and significance of patterns or pattern usages presented, the presentation of the poster during the session, and the level of involvement of the author during the revision phase and poster session discussions during the workshop.
