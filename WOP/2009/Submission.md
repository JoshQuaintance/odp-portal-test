##   Paper and Poster Submissions


We invite the submission of original research results related to the focus areas of the workshop. Research papers should present mature work and document established results. Poster papers may present work-in-progress (e.g. position papers), presentations of implemented systems, preliminary results of issues still under development, and other kinds of results suitable presentation in a poster format.


__Submission guidelines__



* Research papers should be no longer than 14 pages, following the Springer LNCS formatting style (see [LNCS style templates](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-2-72376-0 "http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-2-72376-0")). Note that papers not adhering to the style guidelines or the maximum page limit will be rejected without review.
* Poster papers should be no longer than 7 pages, following the same style as the research papers.
* Submissions should be in English, and non-native speakers are encouraged to seek assistance from native English speakers to ensure a correct language.
* Submission of the papers should be done through the EasyChair conference site, available at [http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wop2009](http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wop2009 "http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wop2009")


__Process__



* Each submission will be reviewed by at least two members of the PC (in case of disagreement a third reviewer will be assigned).
* The final decision will be made by the paper/poster chair, based on the reviews.
* The following criteria will be specifically taken into consideration:
	+ utility and applicability of the approach/pattern/system described,
	+ contribution of the paper to the research community,
	+ originality of the approach,
	+ relevance of the topic and findings to the workshop subjects,
	+ quality of the research process,
	+ and quality of the writing.
* Accepted papers/posters will be required to address the comments of the reviewers in the camera ready version.
* At least one author of each paper must register for, and attend, the workshop to present the paper/poster.


__Important dates for paper and poster submission__



* Research paper and poster paper submission deadline __\*EXTENDED\*__ - __August 21__ (11:59pm CET)
* Paper/poster notification of acceptance - __September 14__
* Camera ready deadline - __September 26__
* Online proceedings published - __October 9__
* Workshop date - __October 25__


##   Pattern Submissions


We invite the submission of research results in the form of ontology design patterns (ODPs). Patterns submitted should have a general relevance to the ontology engineering field, or specific interest within a knowledge domain. Patterns should solve some particular problem, and be of significant interest for discussion at the workshop. Patterns should be original, in the sense that they are the intellectual product of the author, however they may still be based on the collective experience of a community. Note that a criteria for acceptance is whether a pattern would constitute a good basis for discussion at the workshop, hence submitting a "perfect" but non-controversial pattern could in principle result in certification of the pattern but a rejection for discussion at the workshop. Patterns submitted can be accompanied by a paper/poster submission, but these will be treated independently, i.e. they will not be reviewed together and the decision for one submission will not affect the other.


__Submission guidelines__



* Patterns should be of one of the following five categories:
	+ Logical ODPs
	+ Architectural ODPs
	+ Content ODPs
	+ Re-engineering ODPs
	+ Alignment ODPs
* Patterns must be fully annotated, using the templates provided in the portal for each category.
* Submit the pattern through the  [ODP submission for the specific pattern type](../../Submissions/SubmitAPattern.md "Submissions:SubmitAPattern") and don't forget to tell us that you are submitting for WOP'09 (i.e. when you edit the pattern page, write WOP2009 in the "event" field).


__Process__



* Each submission will be reviewed by at least two members of the PC or the ODP portal Quality Committee (in case of disagreement a third reviewer will be assigned)
* The final decision will be made by the pattern chairs, based on the reviews.
* The following criteria will be specifically taken into consideration:
	+ the practical utility and reusability of the pattern by a community,
	+ the relevance of the problem addressed by the pattern,
	+ if the pattern encodes some best practice within a community,
	+ and whether the pattern presents a problem suitable for discussion and the workshop.
* When a pattern is accepted the authors are also required to describe the pattern in an extended abstract (formatting instructions - see regular papers), of maximum 4 pages. The extended abstract must be submitted before the camera ready deadline of papers, and will be included in the online proceedings.
* Accepted patterns will be assigned an advisor (a member of the PC or the ODP Quality Committee) who will discuss the reviews and the pattern with the author, and assist the revision of the pattern by proposing necessary changes and updates before the final upload (deadline see below).
* At least one pattern author must register for, and attend, the workshop to present and discuss the pattern.
* At the workshop each pattern will be given a time slot for discussion, including the following parts:
	+ A brief presentation of the pattern by the author.
	+ An overview of the discussion (reviews and subsequent updates), presented by the advisor, who also indicates main points of interest, main merits and weaknesses of the pattern, and initiates the discussion with the author.
	+ The audience participates in the discussion and specific focus is given to possible improvements to the pattern.
* After the workshop the author is given a second opportunity to improve the pattern, thereafter the pattern may be proposed for certification and inclusion in the ODP official catalogue.
