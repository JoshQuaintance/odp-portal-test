Below is the final program for WOP 2009, accepted papers and patterns with links are moved to the end of the page.


Proceedings can be found here: [[1]](http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/Publications/CEUR-WS/Vol-516/ "http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/Publications/CEUR-WS/Vol-516/")


  

__Important information for presenters:__


_Paper presentations_ have a time limit of 20 minutes (+5min questions). Please put slides on a memory stick and contact the session chair before the session to transfer all the slides of the session to one computer. If you really need your own laptop, e.g. for doing a demo, please test the setup in the room before the session starts. 


_Pattern presenters_ (discussion session) have 5 minutes to briefly present the pattern, then the advisor of the pattern will use 5 minutes to present the current open issues (as given by the reviewers and collected during previous discussion between the author and advisor). The remaining 25 minutes will be used for discussing these open issues and other possible improvements of the pattern. __Note:__ this is not a question-answering session, the pattern author must be open to changing his or her pattern and the workshop participants are obliged to provide constructive criticism and concrete ideas for improvement. 


All _poster presenters_ (both short papers and posters) are obliged to prepare a 1 minute lightning talk, advertising their poster (strict timing, no slides allowed). Posters should preferably be in A1 format and will be posted on the walls of the workshop room.
