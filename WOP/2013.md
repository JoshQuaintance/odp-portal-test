##   Welcome to the Workshop on Ontology and Semantic Web Patterns (4th edition) - WOP2013


This is the fourth edition in a series of workshops addressing the topic of __ontology and semantic web patterns as best practices__, related to the [_ontologydesignpatterns.org_](../Ontology_Design_Patterns_._org_(ODP).md).html "Ontology Design Patterns . org (ODP)") initiative. 


Patterns need to be shared by a community in order to provide a common language, and to stimulate pattern usage and development. Hence, the aim of this workshop is twofold 



* providing an arena for proposing and discussing good practices, patterns, pattern-based ontologies, systems etc., and
* broadening the pattern community that is developing its own “language” for discussing and describing relevant problems and their solutions.


For more background on the workshop series, see the  [main page](../WOP/Main.md "WOP:Main").


WOP2013 will be a half-day workshop consisting of two parts: paper presentations and posters. The poster session will feature pattern posters, i.e. presentations of patterns submitted according the  [call for patterns](../WOP/2013.md#Call_for_Patterns "WOP:2013"). 



  




##   Venue and dates


The fourth edition of WOP will be held on __October 21st (morning session)__, in conjunction with [ISWC 2013](http://www.iswc2013.semanticweb.org/ "http://www.iswc2013.semanticweb.org/") at the [Sydney Masonic Conference & Function Centre](http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/venue "http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/venue")  in the Sydney CBD, Australia ([ISWC venue details](http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/venue#workshops "http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/venue#workshops"))

##   Call for Papers - Topics


Submission instruction for research papers (including position papers) can be found at the  [submission page](../WOP/2013/Submission.md "WOP:2013/Submission").


The main aim of the workshop is to discuss and collect solutions to recurrent problems that matter to researchers and practitioners of the Semantic Web field, and that impact on design and engineering of ontologies, linked data, knowledge extraction, and other semantic web applications. Original research papers and poster papers are invited to consider the following (non exhaustive) list of topics:



* __Ontology Design Patterns (ODP)__
	+ foundations of ODP
	+ automatic extraction of ODP
	+ ODP-based ontologies
	+ domain specific ODP and application use cases
	+ anti-Patterns or pitfalls in ontology modeling
	+ foundational ODP
	+ ODP and their relations with standards
	+ analysis of ODP usage
	+ evaluation of ODP (methods, benchmarks)
	+ languages for representing ODP
	+ ODP as context for reasoning


* __Semantic Web patterns__
	+ Patterns in semantic wikis, blogs, social networks
	+ Linked data patterns and their relation to ODP
	+ NLP patterns and linguistic frames and their relation to ODP and linked data
	+ Reasoning patterns
	+ Data and graph mining patterns and their relation to ODP and linked data
	+ navigation/browsing patterns and their relation to ODP and linked data
	+ Reengineering patterns for conceptual models, folksonomies, lexicons, thesauri


* __Tools, methods and applications__
	+ pattern-based knowledge and ontology engineering
	+ architectural patterns for semantic web applications
	+ ODP and linked data visualization
	+ pattern-based ontology and linked data learning
	+ N-ary fact extraction and representation


  




##   Call for Patterns


We invite the submission of research results in the form of ontology design patterns (ODPs). 
Patterns submitted should have a general relevance to the ontology engineering field, or specific interest within a knowledge domain. Patterns should solve some particular modeling problem, and be of significant interest for discussion at the workshop. Patterns should be original, in the sense that they are the intellectual product of the author(s), however they may still be based on the collective experience of a community.


Pattern submissions for the pattern session will be collected:



* through the [ODP portal](../Submissions/SubmitAPattern.md "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:SubmitAPattern") and
* by submitting a description of the pattern (pattern description) via [EasyChair]


Detailed instructions for patterns submission, including how to submit via the ontologydesignpatterns.org portal, are found at the  [submission page](../WOP/2013/Submission.md "WOP:2013/Submission"). Note that an account in the ODP portal is needed for submitting patterns; thus, authors should take care to request an account at least one week before their intended submission.


Pattern submissions can be made in any type of ODPs. Currently, portal templates for submission are provided for the following types of patterns (see general [typology](../OPTypes.md "OPTypes") for explanation of the types):



* Content patterns
* Structural patterns: logical and architecture patterns.
* Correspondence patterns: re-engineering and alignment patterns.


For other types of patterns, the author is welcome to submit only a pattern description.


  




##   Submission and Important Dates


For details on how to submit to WOP2013 see the  [submission page](../WOP/2013/Submission.md "WOP:2013/Submission"). 


__Important dates__



* Extended Submission deadline (research papers and patterns) - __July 19th (11:59 Hawaii time)__
* Notification of acceptance (research papers and patterns) - __August 12th__
* Camera ready deadline (research papers and pattern abstracts) - __September 3rd__ (extended)
* Workshop date - __October 21st (morning session)__


####   Best Poster Award


Workshop participants will be able to vote for the best poster, final decision to be made by the chairs. The best poster award takes into account criteria such as the quality of the submission, the relevance and significance of patterns or pattern usages presented, the presentation of the poster during the "lightning talks", and the level of involvement of the author during the revision phase and poster session discussions during the workshop.



##  Proceedings


Accepted research papers and pattern descriptions will be published online as CEUR-Workshop Proceedings.
