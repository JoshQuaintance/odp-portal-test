#   12th Workshop on Ontology Design and Patterns - WOP2021


This is the twelfth edition in a series of workshops addressing the topic of __ontology and semantic web patterns as best practices__, related to the [_ontologydesignpatterns.org_](/wiki/Ontology_Design_Patterns_._org_%28ODP%29 "Ontology Design Patterns . org (ODP)") initiative.


The workshop series covers issues related to quality in ontology design and ontology design patterns (ODPs) for data and knowledge engineering in Semantic Web. The increased attention to ODPs in recent years through their interaction with emerging trends of Semantic Web such as knowledge graphs can be attributed to their benefit for knowledge engineers and Semantic Web developers. Such benefits come in the form of a direct link to requirements, reuse, guidance, and better communication. The workshop’s aim is thus not just: 1) providing an arena for discussing patterns, pattern-based ontologies, systems, datasets, but also 2) broadening the pattern community by developing its own "discourse" for discussing and describing relevant problems and their solutions.


For more background on the workshop series, see the  [main page](/wiki/WOP:Main "WOP:Main").


WOP2021 is a _full-day workshop_ consisting of three parts: keynote presentation, paper presentation session, and an interactive Q&A discussion session.

#   Call for Papers and Patterns


We invite the submission of original research results related to the focus areas of the workshop, in one of three categories:



1. Research papers (maximum 15 pages LNCS style) presenting mature work and established results.
2. Short papers (maximum 5 pages LNCS style) presenting proposed research directions, novel ideas, or more general positions or discussions.
3. Ontology Design Patterns (described in paper format, 5-12 pages LNCS style) should solve a particular modeling problem, of relevance either to the broader ontology engineering community or to some specific knowledge domain, in a novel and reusable manner. These must additionally be submitted through the ODP community portal.


##   Topics of interest


Topics include but are not limited to:



1. Use of ontology design patterns for any kind of knowledge engineering, including

	* Pattern-based ontology design, conceptual modeling or knowledge engineering broadly
	* Use in knowledge graphs or linked data settings (including pattern-driven linking or data publishing)
	* Pattern-based information extraction, ontology learning, and relation to NLP
	* Use in streaming, ingesting or evolving knowledge
	* Use of patterns for ontology evaluation, quality assurance, ontology selection, integration or alignment
	* Pattern-based development of semantic applications
	* Reasoning with patterns (including automated reasoning, verification, or contextual reasoning)
2. Methods and tools for developing high-quality ontologies (with or without the help of patterns), including

	* Ontology engineering by domain experts
	* Quality attributes or metrics in ontologies and ontology engineering
	* Quality assurance approaches for ontology engineering
	* Critical analysis of the design of existing ontologies, and proposals on how to improve the design, possibly by using ODPs

	* Pattern extraction
	* Analyses of ontology design patterns or their uses
	* Antipatterns and their relations to ODPs
4. Development and use of patterns in specific domains, including
