__[GerdGroener](../User/GerdGroener.md "User:GerdGroener") about [Standard Enforcer Pattern](../Submissions/Standard_Enforcer_Pattern.md "Submissions:Standard Enforcer Pattern") (Revision ID: [Enforcer Pattern?oldid=11149 11149](../Submissions/Standard.md "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Standard"))__
Overall suggestion (score): 1 - needs minor revision




 __Review Summary:__ Pattern Summary
The proposed pattern describes modelling guidelines
to describe a standard and the process that enforce the standard.


Evaluation of the Pattern


The pattern is useful and the example helps to understand the pattern.
I would suggest to elaborate the ontological presentation of the patter,
i.e., explain in more detail the modelling principles (in OWL) of the pattern
as depicted in Fig. 1.
Furthermore, Fig. 1 is not readable as some text is missing (not completely displayed).
Thus, for the final submission, both the Figure and the explanation of 



the OWL-modelling principles have to be improved/added.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ high
__Problems:__ As mentioned above, the presentation needs some improvements:
- Figure 1: Text is missing, some annotations are cut



- Explanation of modelling principles (Explain modelling and design decisions of the patters, i.e., explain the modelling rationale of Figure 1.
__Community Relevance:__ The pattern is relevant.
__Relation to Best Practices:__ 
__Reusability:__ The pattern is reusable.
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ 
__Overall Understandability:__ The graphical representation (Figure 1) and the textual explanation of the pattern could be improved.
__Clear Problem Description:__ The problem is clearly described.
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ 
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ see comments above regarding Figure 1
__Missing Information:__
