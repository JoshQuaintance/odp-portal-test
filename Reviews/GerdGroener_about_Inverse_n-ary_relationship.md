__[GerdGroener](../User/GerdGroener.md "User:GerdGroener") about [Inverse n-ary relationship](../Submissions/Inverse_n-ary_relationship.md "Submissions:Inverse n-ary relationship") (Revision ID: [n-ary relationship?oldid=10060 10060](../Submissions/Inverse.md "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Inverse"))__
Overall suggestion (score): 1 - needs minor revision




 __Review Summary:__ The pattern extends (or restricts) the n-ary relationship pattern (Pattern1) from W3C. In the W3C pattern, the elements of the n-ary relation are non-distinguished. In this case, the inverse property means defining the inverse property of all properties.
The proposed pattern makes a simple, but from my point of view a quite restricting assumption. In the n-ary relation, there are two distinguishable elements and the ontology engineer is only interested of the inverse property of the property that connects this two elements.
The other elements are considered as optional.


  




Concerning this restriction, I doubt that this is really a n-ary relation! The focus is only on the relations between this two distinguishable elements. The others can be neglected.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ high
__Problems:__ As already said, the main problem is that this is not really a n-ary relation.
__Community Relevance:__ high
__Relation to Best Practices:__ good
__Reusability:__ borderline
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ 
__Overall Understandability:__ Could be improved:
Firstly, I would use the same type of diagram as on the W3C page. Secondly, I suggest to give an example with a diagram for your pattern. Moreover, I would use one of the examples that are given on the W3C page.
__Clear Problem Description:__ 
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ 
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ Could be improved (see above):
Give the example in the same representation style like on the web page of W3C.
__Missing Information:__
