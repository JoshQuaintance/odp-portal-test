__[RinkeHoekstra](../User/RinkeHoekstra "User:RinkeHoekstra") about [OOPMetrics](../Submissions/OOPMetrics "Submissions:OOPMetrics") (Revision ID: [11169](../Submissions/OOPMetrics@oldid=11169 "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:OOPMetrics?oldid=11169"))__
Overall suggestion (score): -1 - reject




 __Review Summary:__ The ontology has very limited motivation, and it is unclear to me how the ontology would form a reusable pattern across different ontologies. The idea of ontology design patterns is that they present fragments of ontologies that are common across multiple domains. An ontology for evaluating OOP, however useful, is not a pattern in that sense, it is a very small ontology in its own right, that has a very specific purpose. Perhaps if this ontology could be generalized to rating/ranking/measuring things in general, it could be a pattern. However, this will require some more substantial backing.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ High
__Problems:__ 
__Community Relevance:__ 
__Relation to Best Practices:__ It is an ontology for measuring best practices in OOP, which is good. However, the ontology itself does not follow best practices (lack of labels, limited documentation etc.
__Reusability:__ Reusable but only for a very specific task.
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ None
__Overall Understandability:__ Ok
__Clear Problem Description:__ Far to limited discussion
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ Relevance is clear for OOP metrics, but not as a pattern.
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ Yes
__Missing Information:__
