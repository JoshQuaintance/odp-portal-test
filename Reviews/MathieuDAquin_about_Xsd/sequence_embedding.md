__[MathieuDAquin](../../User/MathieuDAquin.md "User:MathieuDAquin") about [Xsd:sequence embedding](../../Submissions/Xsd/sequence_embedding.md "Submissions:Xsd:sequence embedding") (Revision ID: [embedding?oldid=5628 5628](../../Submissions/Xsd/sequence.md "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Xsd:sequence"))__
Overall suggestion (score): 0 - needs major revision




 __Review Summary:__ I don't really understand this pattern.
It seems to be representing the notion of sequence of objects, but focusing on the relation between the representation of sequence in XSD and the one in ontologies. 



My impression is that this pattern is more generic and that the link with XSD is only one possible usage of it.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ As I said, I don't understand it.
__Problems:__ I don't see what format level consideration should be included in design pattern definition.
Also, the ontology representation is not clear.. is it only a partOf pattern. The notion of sequence does not appear.
__Community Relevance:__ I guess it is relevant in the proposed scenario.
__Relation to Best Practices:__ 
__Reusability:__ Limited I believe.
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ PartOf
__Overall Understandability:__ There is a lot of description, but it doesn't help a lot in understanding how the pattern can be used.
__Clear Problem Description:__ 
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ 
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ 
__Missing Information:__
