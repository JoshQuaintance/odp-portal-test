__[GerdGroener](../User/GerdGroener.md "User:GerdGroener") about [SimpleOrAggregated](../Submissions/SimpleOrAggregated.md "Submissions:SimpleOrAggregated") (Revision ID: [10097](../Submissions/SimpleOrAggregated@oldid=10097.md "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:SimpleOrAggregated?oldid=10097"))__
Overall suggestion (score): 2 - accept for certification




 __Review Summary:__ The pattern describes a disjoint partition of objects into simple and aggregated objects that consist of at least two objects.
The proposed solution seems to be sound. 



There is just one minor remark (see problems).
__Reviewer Confidence:__ high
__Problems:__ I was a bit distracted by the terms "non-transitive fashion". What is non-transitive? Are the aggregated objects non-transitive connected? Is it relevant or why is it relevant?
This should be clarified in the final version
__Community Relevance:__ good
__Relation to Best Practices:__ good
__Reusability:__ 
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ 
__Overall Understandability:__ See the comment above (Problems)
__Clear Problem Description:__ 
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ 
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ 
__Missing Information:__
