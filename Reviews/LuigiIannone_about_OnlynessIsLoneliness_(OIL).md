__[LuigiIannone](../User/LuigiIannone.md "User:LuigiIannone") about [OnlynessIsLoneliness (OIL)](../Submissions/OnlynessIsLoneliness_(OIL).md).md).html "Submissions:OnlynessIsLoneliness (OIL)") (Revision ID: [(OIL)?oldid=5621 5621](../Submissions/OnlynessIsLoneliness.md "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:OnlynessIsLoneliness"))__
Overall suggestion (score): 1 - needs minor revision




 __Review Summary:__ In order to avoid the confusion I would rather describe the solution as the pattern, rather than the anti-pattern. Therefore, i would leave the motivation untouched but I'd reword the aim. Instead of describing the common mistake and its possible correction, I would start describing the situation, i.e.: a universal value restriction on a property that has, in fact, as its range the union of two disjunct classes.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ Good
__Problems:__ I would add some natural language description of the problem example to the bare OWL code.
__Community Relevance:__ 
__Relation to Best Practices:__ 
__Reusability:__ 
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ 
__Overall Understandability:__ Rewording the Aim section will avoid confusion between the anti-pattern and the proposed solution.
Commenting the problem example with more text in addition to the OWL could certainly improve the understandability of the pattern.
__Clear Problem Description:__ 
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ Something more could be said in the motivation about the consequences that using the wrong solution (anti-pattern) could have in terms of consistency of the ontology and satisfiability of its classes
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ 
__Missing Information:__
