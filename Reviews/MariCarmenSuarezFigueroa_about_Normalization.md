__[MariCarmenSuarezFigueroa](../User/MariCarmenSuarezFigueroa "User:MariCarmenSuarezFigueroa") about [Normalization](../Submissions/Normalization "Submissions:Normalization") (Revision ID: [10115](../Submissions/Normalization@oldid=10115 "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Normalization?oldid=10115"))__
Overall suggestion (score): 1 - needs minor revision




 __Review Summary:__ The pattern provides a solution to represent multi-inheritance.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ High
__Problems:__ Apart from the problems already pointed out by Catherine and Boris, I would like to mention that the solution has also inconvenience that should be included in the description. For example, sometimes to state explicitly the hierarchy is better than provide axioms to implicitly define it (e.g. Na√Øve developers can include errors in the axioms).
__Community Relevance:__ 
__Relation to Best Practices:__ 
__Reusability:__ I see here a problem with respect to the restrictions that should be included by developers. This could be a place of problems in the modelling, because of the difficulties of thinking about restrictions that allow to classify classes.
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ 
__Overall Understandability:__ In general the pattern is well explained.
__Clear Problem Description:__ The problem description is ok; however, I would like to comment that the problem example (with the figure) is not clear enough. I mean it is not clear the meaning of the first hierarchy and of the second; I assume 'classify' means to run a reasoner, but I think this should be explained in the pattern.
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ 
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ 
__Missing Information:__
