This area aims at collecting all the reviews provided by experts from the ODP  [Quality Committee](../QualityCommittee.md "QualityCommittee").


Reviews are a community asset: they express ideas and rationales that can be (re)used as good practices for ontology evaluation by those who want to submit Content OP proposals or to evaluate their ontology. 


Below is a list of already available reviews.


If you want to contribute or you have been assigned a review, and you are a member of the  [Quality Committee](../QualityCommittee.md "QualityCommittee"), you can  [submit your review](../Reviews/PostReview.md "Reviews:PostReview").
