__[BorisVillazón-Terrazas](../User/BorisVillazón-Terrazas "User:BorisVillazón-Terrazas") about [Standard Enforcer Pattern](../Submissions/Standard_Enforcer_Pattern "Submissions:Standard Enforcer Pattern") (Revision ID: [Enforcer Pattern?oldid=11210 11210](../Submissions/Standard "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Standard"))__
Overall suggestion (score): 1 - needs minor revision




 __Review Summary:__ The proposed pattern describes modelling guidelines to describe a standard and the process that enforce the standard.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ Medium
__Problems:__ The author has to explain, in a better way, the modelling principles of the Figure 1.
One minor comment, regarding the OWL file. Probably this is for all patterns.



The community is adopting TURTLE as human-readable syntax for RDF, so I would prefer to have the patterns in TURTLE instead of RDF/XML.
__Community Relevance:__ The pattern is relevant
__Relation to Best Practices:__ I would need more use cases for this pattern.
__Reusability:__ The pattern is reusable
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ 
__Overall Understandability:__ The pattern needs to be explained in a better way. Also the author needs to improve the description of the uses cases.
__Clear Problem Description:__ The problem is clearly described.
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ 
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ 
__Missing Information:__ Use case/Scenario
