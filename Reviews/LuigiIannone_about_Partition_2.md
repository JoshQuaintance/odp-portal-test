Overall suggestion (score): 1 - needs minor revision




 __Review Summary:__ The example could be more explanatory, maybe describing a real ontology situation rather than using letters. A scenario could be added too.
Although the pattern is a fundamental one, it is described in its simplest incarnation. There are more complicated forms of partitions, for instance including a hierarchy inside the partitions (see Spiciness in the Pizza Tutorial Ontology - [http://www.co-ode.org/ontologies/pizza/2007/02/12/pizza.owl](http://www.co-ode.org/ontologies/pizza/2007/02/12/pizza.owl "http://www.co-ode.org/ontologies/pizza/2007/02/12/pizza.owl")). This version is so lightweight that a live workshop discussion is superfluous.
