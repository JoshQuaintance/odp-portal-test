__[MariaPoveda](../User/MariaPoveda "User:MariaPoveda") about [Template Instance](../Submissions/Template_Instance "Submissions:Template Instance") (Revision ID: [Instance?oldid=11178 11178](../Submissions/Template "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Template"))__
Overall suggestion (score): 1 - needs minor revision




 __Review Summary:__ This pattern's aim is to reduce the number of reified instances in an ontology for those cases where the reified properties are identical for multiple entities.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ Medium
__Problems:__ In my opinion this pattern could be a reengineering ontology pattern rather than a content pattern. It does not provides solutions for any particular Competency Question or modelling problem.
In addition the associated building block does not seem to be really reusable. As it only contains one annotation property, it could be easier to reproduce the building block in an ontology rather than to reuse the owl file attached to the pattern. 



Finally, it would be nice to know the rationales for defining "isTemplate" as an annotation property (that has the value True) instead of for example a boolean datatype property.
