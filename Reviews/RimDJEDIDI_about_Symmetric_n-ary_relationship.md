__[RimDJEDIDI](../User/RimDJEDIDI "User:RimDJEDIDI") about [Symmetric n-ary relationship](../Submissions/Symmetric_n-ary_relationship "Submissions:Symmetric n-ary relationship") (Revision ID: [n-ary relationship?oldid=10106 10106](../Submissions/Symmetric "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Symmetric"))__
Overall suggestion (score): 0 - needs major revision




 __Review Summary:__ This pattern is proposed to model Symmetric n-ary relationship by explicitly expressing that participating classes have the same attributes and values of these attributes; while avoiding redundancy representation.
the general problem addressed by this pattern (modeling issues) is not defined. Besides, the pattern is not explained neither presented as a generic solution. Solution description is not sufficiently convincingÂ : do cardinality and equivalentClass axioms guarantee the purpose of the pattern?


Explanation, proof and implementation are missed. And this is very important when proposing an ODP to be reused.



the given example is not suitable as it is based on a symmetric binary-relationship.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ Competence in ODPs in general and addressed problem.
__Problems:__ 
__Community Relevance:__ 
__Relation to Best Practices:__ 
__Reusability:__ 
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ 
__Overall Understandability:__ 
__Clear Problem Description:__ 
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ 
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ 
__Missing Information:__
