__[HenrikEriksson](../User/HenrikEriksson.md "User:HenrikEriksson") about [Partition](../Submissions/Partition.md "Submissions:Partition") (Revision ID: [5748](../Submissions/Partition@oldid=5748.md "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Partition?oldid=5748"))__
Overall suggestion (score): 0 - needs major revision




 __Review Summary:__ This is definitely a pattern that should be every ontology engineer's toolbox. However, the current description is poor. The wording in the motivation and aim should be improved and examples added.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ High
__Problems:__ The pattern documentation needs improvements. Examples should be added.
__Community Relevance:__ Relevant, but somewhat trivial.
__Relation to Best Practices:__ This pattern is quite universal and commonly used (although you may not think of it).
__Reusability:__ The pattern is generic.
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ 
__Overall Understandability:__ Fundamentally, the pattern is easy to understand. However, the current description is unclear which makes the pattern more difficult to understand.
__Clear Problem Description:__ Currently, none at all.
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ No.
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ Currently, no figures.
__Missing Information:__ Problem description, examples, figures.
