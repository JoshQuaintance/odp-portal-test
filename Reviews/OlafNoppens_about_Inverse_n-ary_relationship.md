__[OlafNoppens](../User/OlafNoppens.md "User:OlafNoppens") about [Inverse n-ary relationship](../Submissions/Inverse_n-ary_relationship.md "Submissions:Inverse n-ary relationship") (Revision ID: [n-ary relationship?oldid=10101 10101](../Submissions/Inverse.md "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Inverse"))__
Overall suggestion (score): 1 - needs minor revision




 __Review Summary:__ This pattern is an extension of the W3C n-ary relationship in that a n-ary realtionship can be summarized in a simple relationship between two individuals.
I can image that querying a knowledge base is easier - however, I encourage the author to clarify and explain how this aim is achieved (give an example, etc.). However, there is one problem with the pattern and that's the name: the pattern does not describe an inverse n-ary relationship but a special kind of it where only two distinguished individuals are considered with "additional, and probably optional, argument".
__Reviewer Confidence:__ high
__Problems:__ There are two problems: first, it's the name as mentioned above, second I would recommend to use the same notation as in the W3C n-ary relationship which is cited. This would make the difference and the understanding clearer.
__Community Relevance:__ good
__Relation to Best Practices:__ good
__Reusability:__ 
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ Unfortunately the n-ary relationship is not available on ontologydesignpatterns.org
__Overall Understandability:__ 
__Clear Problem Description:__ 
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ 
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ 
__Missing Information:__ Example in OWL
