Overall suggestion (score): 1 - needs minor revision




 __Review Summary:__ This pattern present the process of transforming an adjacency list into an owl class hierarchy. The problem is simple, well described and well illustrated. My only concern is that the relation between the termis in the adjacency list might not correspond to a subclass relation. In this case the pattern shouldn't be used. This should be explicitely mentioned.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ I am confident given this is an easy problem.
__Problems:__ Clearly stated.
__Community Relevance:__ This might be useful even if the problem is rather simple.
__Relation to Best Practices:__ Yes this represent a best practice. No alternative solution is mentioned but the given algorithm is certainly the optimal one.
__Reusability:__ The pattern cannot be used in every situations. Only when the adjacency list models a subsumption relation. This should be clearly mentioned in the pattern description.
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ 
__Overall Understandability:__ Overall very understandable.
__Clear Problem Description:__ yes
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ Not clear. Please state this pattern is only valid if the adjacency list supposes a subsumption between the entities.
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ Yes
__Missing Information:__ Already mentioned
