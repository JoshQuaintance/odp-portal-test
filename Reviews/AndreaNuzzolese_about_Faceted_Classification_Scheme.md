__[AndreaNuzzolese](../User/AndreaNuzzolese "User:AndreaNuzzolese") about [Faceted Classification Scheme](../Submissions/Faceted_Classification_Scheme "Submissions:Faceted Classification Scheme") (Revision ID: [Classification Scheme?oldid=10104 10104](../Submissions/Faceted "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Faceted"))__
Overall suggestion (score): 1 - needs minor revision




 __Review Summary:__ The pattern is well described and presents an acceptable and good modelling example respect to the Faceted Classification Scheme. The FSC pattern is related to the Normalization pattern and the motivations are clear and they derive from classifying needs. What is not immediatly clear is how eventual issues from the Normalization pattern imply issues in the FSC pattern. Furthermore the approach taken seems to provide the possibility to use different implementation of the Normalization pattern from the suggested one.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ High.
__Problems:__ Related to the issues from the Normalization pattern.
__Community Relevance:__ 
__Relation to Best Practices:__ 
__Reusability:__ High.
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ Normalization pattern.
__Overall Understandability:__ Good
__Clear Problem Description:__ Good.
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ High.
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ Medium.
__Missing Information:__
