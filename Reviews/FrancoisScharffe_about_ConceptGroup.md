Overall suggestion (score): 0 - needs major revision




 __Review Summary:__ This pattern is meant to be used to represent group memberships of concepts. Sub and super groups can be represented, and both extensional (declared) and intensional (according to a property) memberships can be modeled. 
The pattern seems interesting but present many shadowed areas. I can deduce from the usage of the terms concept ans broader/narrower relations that this pattern is to be used together with the SKOS vocabulary. If this is the case this should be made explicit. Otherwise, what is a concept wrt an owl:ClassÂ ?
I lack an example instantiation of the pattern.
The Solution Description contains questions ... Questions are no solutions...



In summary I think it is an interesting pattern which could certainly find applications when publishing terminologies with SKOS. The pattern however needs to be better described. This pattern can definitely lead to interesting discussions.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ average
__Problems:__ The problem of modeling group membership is important
__Community Relevance:__ relevant
__Relation to Best Practices:__ If there are other solutions they are not mentioned by the pattern.
__Reusability:__ Yesm this pattern seem to be usable in a variety of situations
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ It is only indicated that this pattern is extracted from SNOMED-CT.
__Overall Understandability:__ Okay
__Clear Problem Description:__ Okay
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ Here it misses a statement about the pattern usage together with SKOS
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ Okay
__Missing Information:__ The pattern description misses an example instanciation.
