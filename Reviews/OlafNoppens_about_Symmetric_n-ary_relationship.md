__[OlafNoppens](../User/OlafNoppens.md "User:OlafNoppens") about [Symmetric n-ary relationship](../Submissions/Symmetric_n-ary_relationship.md "Submissions:Symmetric n-ary relationship") (Revision ID: [n-ary relationship?oldid=10066 10066](../Submissions/Symmetric.md "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Symmetric"))__
Overall suggestion (score): 0 - needs major revision




 __Review Summary:__ The patterns tries to express a symmetric n-ary relationship, i.e., that an individual A is related to an individual B with some additional attributes, and that B is related to A with exactly the same attributes. As a matter of course, it can be modelled with a traditional n-ary relationship pattern - but the symmetry has to be modelled explicitly. The patterns tries to eliminate this kind of redundancy.
However, it is not clear what the semantics of a "symmetric n-ary relationship" is. The use case (connection points and their distance) can't help because there are no n arguments. In that sense I understand it as a binary relationship with an additional attribute. The name "symmetric n-nary relationship" is misleading.



But even then it is not clear how the symmetry is guaranteered with the equivalent axiom: It seems to be a special case of a n-ary relationship where two instantiations wrt. one property is demanded.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ high
__Problems:__ As already said the main problem is the semantics of a "symmetric n-ary relationship". It also lacks for an explanation/proof of the implementation (which is not clear for me).
__Community Relevance:__ high
__Relation to Best Practices:__ 
__Reusability:__ 
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ 
__Overall Understandability:__ 
__Clear Problem Description:__ 
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ 
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ 
__Missing Information:__ As the pattern is related to the W3C n-ary relationship I suggest to use the same type of diagram and/or examples. Moreover, an example in OWL and/or OWL building blocks are missing.
