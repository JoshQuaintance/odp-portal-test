Overall suggestion (score): 0 - needs major revision




 __Review Summary:__ The proposed pattern (or anti-pattern) is useful for ontology
engineering, especially for less experienced developers.
It focuses a common modeling problem.
The proposed anti-pattern is technical sound.
However, it is quite simple.


Due to the simplicity of the pattern there are



few discussion issues at WOP.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ The reviewer is familiar with ODPs in general and with the described modeling issue and proposed solution.
__Problems:__ Due to the simplicity of the pattern I doubt that the notion of a
design pattern somehow changes to a collection of simple modeling



primitives.
__Community Relevance:__ Definitely relevant for the community.
__Relation to Best Practices:__ Relevant to best practice modeling.
__Reusability:__ The pattern is reusable.
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ 
__Overall Understandability:__ The motivation of the pattern is well written. Unfortunately there is a breakup in the text.
The overall description of the pattern is well understandable.
__Clear Problem Description:__ The problem is clearly described.
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ The relevance of the pattern and its benefits are given.
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ Figures are missing.
__Missing Information:__ Provide simple examples: ontology + description.
