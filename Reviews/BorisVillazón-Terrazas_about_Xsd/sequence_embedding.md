__[BorisVillazón-Terrazas](../../User/BorisVillazón-Terrazas.md "User:BorisVillazón-Terrazas") about [Xsd:sequence embedding](../../Submissions/Xsd/sequence_embedding.md "Submissions:Xsd:sequence embedding") (Revision ID: [embedding?oldid=5723 5723](../../Submissions/Xsd/sequence.md "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Xsd:sequence"))__
Overall suggestion (score): 0 - needs major revision




 __Review Summary:__ I think a reengineering pattern for partOf relation in XML-based documents is more general than the XSD case presented. So, the XSD case would be an example of the pattern. Also, the output is just an excerpt of an ontology.
The pattern is suitable for presentation at WOP, but after a major revision.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ Medium
__Problems:__ The xsd:sequence implies also the order of the contained elements. The pattern does not take into account this feature.
__Community Relevance:__ High
__Relation to Best Practices:__ 
__Reusability:__ Limited
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ partOf
__Overall Understandability:__ Low
__Clear Problem Description:__ Not clear
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ Not clear
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ In spite figures are clear, the overall pattern is not clear.
__Missing Information:__
