__[StefanoDavid](../User/StefanoDavid "User:StefanoDavid") about [NegativePropertyAssertions](../Submissions/NegativePropertyAssertions "Submissions:NegativePropertyAssertions") (Revision ID: [5778](../Submissions/NegativePropertyAssertions@oldid=5778 "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:NegativePropertyAssertions?oldid=5778"))__
Overall suggestion (score): 0 - needs major revision




 __Review Summary:__ The purpose of this pattern is to allowe negative object property assertion in OWL 1, which are not allowed directly.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ Not fully aware of all details of OWL2 constructors and semantics, but knowledgeable in Description logics and OWL1
__Problems:__ Some comment:
* The pattern seems very useful, expecially if used (possible use case) in knowledge systems where is difficult to migrate knowledge bases from OWL1 to OWL2, for different reasons.


* the functional syntax seems wrong: According to the W3C specs, it should be NegativeObjectPropertyAssertion(ns:prop ns:i1 ns:i2)


* it seems to me more a reengineering pattern, as it relates two similar but different languages.


* I am not completely sure that there is an equivalence relation among the LHS and the LHS, so I expect a proof or explanation accompaning it


* The modeling problem is well stated, but besides the proposed solution, no documentation is provided (ise cases, scenario, etc.)


__Community Relevance:__ medium
__Relation to Best Practices:__ It can be seen as a good pattern to express (as stated by the author) a logical construct not present in one language
__Reusability:__ Possibly, but some use case should be provided.
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ Not in my knowledge
__Overall Understandability:__ See comments above: problem clear stated, but solution less documented
__Clear Problem Description:__ Yes
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ They are not clearly stated, but intuitively understandable
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ None provided
__Missing Information:__ Overall documentation
