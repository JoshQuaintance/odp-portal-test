__[ValentinaPresutti](../User/ValentinaPresutti.md "User:ValentinaPresutti") about [Biological Entities](../Submissions/Biological_Entities.md "Submissions:Biological Entities") (Revision ID: [Entities?oldid=2011 2011](../Submissions/Biological.md "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Biological"))__
Overall suggestion (score): 




 __Review Summary:__ The CP needs to be improved.
* All ontology elements have to be associated with a description.
* The domain and range is the same for the three object properties: [biological\_entity](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Special:AddData/Ontology Element Form/Submissions:Biological_Entities/biological_entity "Submissions:Biological Entities/biological entity (not yet written)").


However, there is a local restriction on their usage. It seems to me that domain and range should be personalized for each object properties as the classes you restrict on are disjoint. In other words, you do not want to allow for example the assigment of a value of  [includesOrder](../Submissions/Biological_Entities/includesOrder.md "Submissions:Biological Entities/includesOrder") for a certain [family](../Submissions/Biological_Entities/family.md "Submissions:Biological Entities/family"). This is now possible as the [includesOrder](../Submissions/Biological_Entities/includesOrder.md "Submissions:Biological Entities/includesOrder") property has domain [biological\_entity](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Special:AddData/Ontology Element Form/Submissions:Biological_Entities/biological_entity "Submissions:Biological Entities/biological entity (not yet written)").



* The CP should import the CP annotation schema ([http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/schemas/cpannotationschema.owl](http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/schemas/cpannotationschema.owl "http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/schemas/cpannotationschema.owl")).
* Which are the competency questions of this CP? And examples?;
