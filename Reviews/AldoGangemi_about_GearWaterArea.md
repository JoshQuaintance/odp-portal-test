Overall suggestion (score): 2 - need major revision




 __Review Summary:__ After Aureliano's evaluation, here you need to link gears to species to water areas, therefore the pattern requires at least three classes, with relations between gears to species, and species to water areas respectively.
The synthetic relation can then be instantiated by using SPARQL CONSTRUCT.



Alternatively, it can be generated with a SWRL rule, or by using an OWL2 alternate pattern, in which a property chain is defined (best practice).
