__[BorisVillazón-Terrazas](../User/BorisVillazón-Terrazas "User:BorisVillazón-Terrazas") about [Normalization](../Submissions/Normalization "Submissions:Normalization") (Revision ID: [10071](../Submissions/Normalization@oldid=10071 "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Normalization?oldid=10071"))__
Overall suggestion (score): 1 - needs minor revision




 __Review Summary:__ This pattern is useful for validating a classification.
The submission needs to be detailed in a few respects:
• Arrange the Solution of the description by enumerating the steps:
o Indetify the modules
o Create the modules, etc
• Provide an example (an owl file of the graphical example),
o maybe an excerpt of an input ontology, and the resultant ontology after the application of the pattern (the owl file)
• Add a link to the Cell type Ontology, I was not able to find it.



• As already Catherine pointed out, it would be good to include in the example a disjoint relation.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ Medium
__Problems:__ This pattern is useful for validating a classification.
__Community Relevance:__ High
__Relation to Best Practices:__ 
__Reusability:__ 
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ Subsumption
__Overall Understandability:__ Good presentation, but it can be improved, according to the suggestion given in the review summary.
__Clear Problem Description:__ Good
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ Good
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ Good
__Missing Information:__ The owl file of the input ontology and the resultant ontology after applying the pattern.
Also, it would be good to include in the example a disjoint relation.
