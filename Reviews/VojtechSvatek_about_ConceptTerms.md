__[VojtechSvatek](../User/VojtechSvatek "User:VojtechSvatek") about [ConceptTerms](../Submissions/ConceptTerms "Submissions:ConceptTerms") (Revision ID: [5714](../Submissions/ConceptTerms@oldid=5714 "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:ConceptTerms?oldid=5714"))__
Overall suggestion (score): 0 - needs major revision




 __Review Summary:__ First of all, the pattern looks quite unfinished and/or sloppy in terms of documentation. Only when the modelling choices are explained, a true review could be done.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ The pattern is currently so simple that not much special expertise is needed. I am confident in my assessment.
__Problems:__ It is not clear what a compound non preferred term looks like and why it is only made of preferred terms.
The reification of the relation between a concept and the terms should be clearly justified.



The scenario is too brief.
__Community Relevance:__ The solution is kind of trivial. There are numerous efforts related to handling lexical aspects of ontologies.
__Relation to Best Practices:__ 
__Reusability:__ High degree of reuse.
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ The pattern should probably mention the SKOS vocabulary, which addresses most of the problems in question.
__Overall Understandability:__ Simple and understandable, except for clearly missing information.
__Clear Problem Description:__ Could do, although I would imagine something a bit different under 'language complexity'.
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ Not much information about consequences.
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ Only the basic diagram, which looks OK.
__Missing Information:__ Especially information (and examples) on compound non-preferred terms.
