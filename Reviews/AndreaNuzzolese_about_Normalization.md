__[AndreaNuzzolese](../User/AndreaNuzzolese "User:AndreaNuzzolese") about [Normalization](../Submissions/Normalization "Submissions:Normalization") (Revision ID: [10115](../Submissions/Normalization@oldid=10115 "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Normalization?oldid=10115"))__
Overall suggestion (score): 1 - needs minor revision




 __Review Summary:__ The aims behind the proposal are very clear to understand and the Normalization pattern can be, with a few revisions, a good solution to them. I agree that in the case of a large polyhierarchy is much better to infer subsumption relationships than hardcode them, but it should be clarify better how the complexity of the reasoning is increased by a lot of new added restrictions, expecially with large data sets of triples. Furthermore adding disjointess can introduce inconsistence in the schema and incoherence in the data.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ High
__Problems:__ 
__Community Relevance:__ 
__Relation to Best Practices:__ 
__Reusability:__ 
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ 
__Overall Understandability:__ The example figure is not so clear and self-explained. I suggest to add some lines to explain how and where restrictions and disjointess clauses are added.
__Clear Problem Description:__ 
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ 
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ 
__Missing Information:__
