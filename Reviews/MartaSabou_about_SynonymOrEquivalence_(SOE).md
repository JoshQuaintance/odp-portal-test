Overall suggestion (score): 0 - needs major revision




 __Review Summary:__ This is a simple but useful solution to an antipattern - the tendency to declare two classes equivalent when in fact their labels simply express synonym.
The pattern and the solution are quite simple, and as a result I do not expect this pattern to lead to lengthy and interesting discussions during the WOP workshop. Additionally, the pattern requires further documentation and more clear solutions (currently the solution link points to a whole directory and it is a rather tedious task to dig up the appropriate solution example) - these two facts forced me to lower my score to 0.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ Medium.
__Problems:__ 
__Community Relevance:__ 
__Relation to Best Practices:__ Good.
__Reusability:__ High.
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ Not known but could be further investigated.
__Overall Understandability:__ Good.
__Clear Problem Description:__ Yes.
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ 
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ None provided.
__Missing Information:__
