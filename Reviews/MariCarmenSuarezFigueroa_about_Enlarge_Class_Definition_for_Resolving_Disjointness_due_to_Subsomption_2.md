Overall suggestion (score): -1 - reject




 __Review Summary:__ It is not clear enough the motivation of this pattern. Indeed, in my opinion the example provided is not a good one (it seems strange to have a class called "Fauna-Flora"; what for me should be two different classes).
__Reviewer Confidence:__ My confidence is high on modeling disjoint classes and hierarchies.
__Problems:__ The main problem for me is due to the example provide in the pattern. It is not clear that such situation should be represented having a class missed different domain elements.
__Community Relevance:__ 
__Relation to Best Practices:__ 
__Reusability:__ 
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ 
__Overall Understandability:__ 
__Clear Problem Description:__ 
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ 
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ 
__Missing Information:__
