Overall suggestion (score): 1 - needs minor revision




 __Review Summary:__ This pattern solves disjointness (caused by subsumption), by defining a hybrid class. It can lead to discussions during WOP.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ Low
__Problems:__ 
__Community Relevance:__ High
__Relation to Best Practices:__ 
__Reusability:__ 
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ 
__Overall Understandability:__ Medium
__Clear Problem Description:__ Yes
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ Yes
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ For a better understanding of the pattern, I think figures can be transformed to PNG.
__Missing Information:__ Perhaps some "real" usage of the proposed pattern can be found.
