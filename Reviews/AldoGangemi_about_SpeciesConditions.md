Overall suggestion (score): 1 - to reject




 __Review Summary:__ After Aureliano's evaluation, this alternate pattern for species conditions does not seem to catch the intended conceptualization by fishery experts ... in principle however, bathymetric ranges can vary with water area: simply this variability can only appear when we combine species and resource data, therefore it is an empirical finding if this pattern is useful or not, and cannot anyway be derived from either competency questions or source schemata.
