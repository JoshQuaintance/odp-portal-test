__[EnricoMotta](../User/EnricoMotta.md "User:EnricoMotta") about [Literal Reification](../Submissions/Literal_Reification.md "Submissions:Literal Reification") (Revision ID: [Reification?oldid=10110 10110](../Submissions/Literal.md "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Literal"))__
Overall suggestion (score): 1 - needs minor revision




 __Review Summary:__ Useful pattern supporting the reification of literal values within OWL, so that they can be used as 'first class objects' in OWL models. The pattern seems valid, however I had trouble trying to browse it in both NeOn and Topbraid, which made my life a bit painful. I am also surprised that the pattern does not clarify how to link the resulting reified literals to the obvious related entities - e,g, an entity such as [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hilton%2C\_Paris](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hilton%2C_Paris "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hilton%2C_Paris"), which describes ParisHilton.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ High
__Problems:__ The OWL source does not load properly in either topbraid or neon. This should be fixed.
__Community Relevance:__ This is very useful pattern applicable to zillions of scenarios
__Relation to Best Practices:__ There are a lot of proposals about how to talk about tags and link web2.0 systems to the semantic web and a comparison with the way other people have tackled this problem would be useful.
__Reusability:__ The pattern is very reusable
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ 
__Overall Understandability:__ The pattern is reasonably easy to understand although the description, context and motivation are rather minimalist
__Clear Problem Description:__ I think the scenario could be made clearer and more meaningful by showing how to link tags to the owl entities denoting the same object as the tag
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ 
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ 
__Missing Information:__ How do I link the tagÂ :parisTag2 in your scenario to [http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hilton%2C\_Paris](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hilton%2C_Paris "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hilton%2C_Paris")?
