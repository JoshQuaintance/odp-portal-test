__[VojtechSvatek](../User/VojtechSvatek "User:VojtechSvatek") about [Context Slices](../Submissions/Context_Slices "Submissions:Context Slices") (Revision ID: [Slices?oldid=10058 10058](../Submissions/Context "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Context"))__
Overall suggestion (score): 1 - needs minor revision




 __Review Summary:__ A reasonable, non-trivial logical pattern.
Some associated modelling decisions should be made more precise. In particular, the domain/range of the new relation is not obvious: is it set to cs:ContextualProjection? How can it be distinguished from the general (factual) relation with the same meaning, which would have natural concepts (such as Company and Person) in domain/range?



To unify terminology, I would prefer to use the name 'Contextual Projection' for the pattern itself, too. (Knowing that Anglo-Saxon people are fond of figurative names such as 'slices'Â ;-))
__Reviewer Confidence:__ The pattern is quite generic and I feel competent to judge it.
__Problems:__ Just as outlined above.
__Community Relevance:__ Yes, it addresses a pretty relevant and important problem.
__Relation to Best Practices:__ For the problem in question, this (or just slightly modified) pattern seems to be best practice.
__Reusability:__ Rather generic.
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ There is obvious relation to the n-ary relation pattern (e.g. by SWBPD) and actually also to RDF reification as kind-of pattern.
__Overall Understandability:__ Neat description aside the missing details as stated above.
__Clear Problem Description:__ Yes, looks clear.
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ Yes, but the consequences could still be elaboreted a bit more.
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ Yes.
__Missing Information:__ As above.
