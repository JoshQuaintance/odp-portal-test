__[MathieuDAquin](../User/MathieuDAquin "User:MathieuDAquin") about [ConceptGroup](../Submissions/ConceptGroup "Submissions:ConceptGroup") (Revision ID: [5660](../Submissions/ConceptGroup@oldid=5660 "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:ConceptGroup?oldid=5660"))__
Overall suggestion (score): 0 - needs major revision




 __Review Summary:__ This pattern, as far as I understand, to represents groups of concepts. 
I think the pattern would be interesting to discuss, but suffer from a number of problems as detailed below.
__Reviewer Confidence:__ I am not really clear about this particular pattern.
__Problems:__ The general issues I see here concern clarity and possible usage.
The first thing is that I am not sure what is meant by concept here. Does it corresponds to the concept of an ontology? In this case shouldn't it be related to owl:Class in the OWL description? This would cause a number of issues at the logical level, in particular, if Group is a concept. This needs to be made clear in my opinion.


Also, Group should be called ConceptGroup.


I don't really understand the difference between subgroup and narrowerThan. Isn't a subgroup narrower?



Finally, I don't see a clear application for this pattern as is.
__Community Relevance:__ Not clear to me.
__Relation to Best Practices:__ The current form of the pattern doesn't seem to relate with best practices, and at least in naming, is not really appropriate.
__Reusability:__ Unclear.
__Relations to Other Patterns:__ PartOf pattern applied to concepts?
__Overall Understandability:__ Low
__Clear Problem Description:__ Not really. I don't in which scenario this helps.
__Clear Relevance and Consequences:__ Not really.
__Clear Figures and Illustrations:__ OK.
__Missing Information:__ example of usage, clear description/definition of the entities.
