The workshop will be held in conjunction with ISWC2010 on November 8th. It will be a full-day workshop consisting of three parts; papers, posters/demos (including pattern posters), and “pattern writing” sessions. Specific focus is put on pattern posters and “pattern writing” sessions as an opportunity for discussing and reaching consensus on best practices in the field. The pattern writing sessions are closely related to another interactive event series, namely VoCamps [1], since certain types of patterns are in fact small vocabularies. The main difference is that this workshop encompasses a broader range of patterns, and the focus is on engineering best practices. Pattern submissions can be made in two categories:* Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs). ODP submissions are reviewed by Pattern PC members, e.g. from the quality committee of the ODP portal[2], and accepted patterns will be presented at the workshop as posters in the joint poster session (together with paper posters as demonstrations).* Problem proposals. Problem proposals are reviewed and voted by the workshop PC and ODP portal committees, and the most interesting ones will be the basis of the practical “pattern writing” at the workshop. ---- Pattern Topics  ----- Ontology design pattern (ODP) submissions will be collected through the ODP portal [2], and templates for submission [3] are provided for the following types of patterns (see general typology [4] for explanation of the types): * Content patterns* Structural patterns: logical and architecture patterns.* Correspondence patterns: re-engineering and alignment patterns. For other types of patterns, or if the author wishes to elaborate on theoretical rather than practical aspects, a pattern description may be submitted as either a research paper or poster paper. A paper submission can be accompanied by a pattern submission, however the submissions will be reviewed separately.  ---- Problem proposals ----Problem proposals should have the following features:* A non-trivial problem that currently has no pattern (generally accepted solution) available* A problem relevant to the workshop community, i.e. an important and interesting problem* The envisioned solution can be classified under one or more of the ODP types described at [4] ---- Process ----- Patterns are submitted through the ODP portal [2,3], and reviewed by at least two members of the ODP portal quality committee. Accepted patterns are to be improved based on the review comments, i.e., an update of the patterns in the ODP portal is mandatory. Accepted patterns are then presented as posters at the workshop, in a joint poster session with paper posters and demos. After the workshop, the patterns may be considered for certification in the ODP portal. Problem proposals are submitted through the “Post Modeling Issue”[5] functionality of the ODP portal. Based on the description of problems the workshop PC and the ODP portal committees will vote for the most interesting and important problems, which will be selected for the “pattern writing” session. At the workshop the person proposing the problem has to be present to explain the problem. The workshop participants will be divided into groups that will draft a solution for the problem. At the end of the session each group presents its draft solution, and if it is mature enough it will be posted in the ODP portal. ---- Best Pattern Award ---- Reviewers and workshop participants will together distinguish the best pattern submission, final decision to be made by the chairs. The best pattern award takes into account criteria such as the quality of the submission, the relevance and significance of the pattern, the presentation of the pattern, and the level of involvement of the author during the revision phase and poster session discussions during the workshop. ---- Important Dates ---- •    Submission deadline - August 20•    Notification of acceptance - September 10•    Workshop date - November 8  Submission instructions at http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/WOP:2010/Submission  ---- WOP2009 Chairs ---- Papers and posters – Valentina Presutti, StLab ISTC-CNR(IT) and Vinay K.
