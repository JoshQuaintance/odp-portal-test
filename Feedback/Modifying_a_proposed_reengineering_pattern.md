#  Modifying a proposed reengineering pattern


__Title:__ modifying a proposed reengineering proposal


__Description:__ I have created a partial reengineering proposal, which i saved. I then found out that I can not modify it anymore.
The amount of information that needs to be entered in one go is too large, and makes the proposal process very cumbersome. 
Intermediate saves and editing options of saved versions should be enabled, whcih would allow an incremental creation of a proposal.
