#  Pattern or generic terms


__Title:__ Pattern or generic terms?


__Description:__ Having a first look at the pattern it's not clear to me when something is a pattern rather than a generic (mini-)ontology. My assumption was that pattern are at a domain independent level of abstraction and concrete domain specific ontologies would fill the pattern entities with domain specific terms. For the proposed content OPs however, I think many of them could be implemented as reusable ontologies rather than being pattern applied to many ontologies.
