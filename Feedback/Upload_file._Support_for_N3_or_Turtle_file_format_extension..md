#  Upload file. Support for N3 or Turtle file format extension.


__Title:__ Upload file. Support for N3 or Turtle file format extension.


__Description:__ The Upload File feature of the Wiki supports various W3C Semantic Web file format extensions such as: .rdf or .owl.


However it does not support the popular, readable, and user-friendly N3 or Turtle file format and there is no file extension associated to it. 


Attempting to upload an N3 or Turtle file reusing the .rdf or .owl file extension produces an error. (File is corrupted).


Attempting to upload an N3 or Turtle file using an .n3 or .ttl file extension produces an error. (File extension is not supported).
