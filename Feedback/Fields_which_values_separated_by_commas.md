#  Fields which values separated by commas


__Title:__ An idea to edit and print fields which values separated by commas


__Description:__ I suggest editing the fields which values separated by commas through a textbox for each value. Some of these fields are “competency questions”, “scenarios”, “Also Known As”, “Known Use”…


You can put a textbox for the first value initially followed by a box with a “+” sign would appear that another box for the next value, and so on. 


In any case these fields would be clearer if they represent each given value in a line.
