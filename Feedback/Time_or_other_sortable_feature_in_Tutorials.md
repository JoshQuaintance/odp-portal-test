#  Time or other sortable feature in Tutorials


__Title:__ Time or other sortable feature in Tutorials


__Description:__ Right now there is no good way to sort the tutorials in the tutorial page, they are all randomly listed, old mixed with new. Right now most of the tutorials are not online tutorials (but this could be a thing we add in the future, i.e. more online tutorials) but actual events that take place IRL. For such events we could add start and end date properties, so that we can sort the tutorials with the most recent on the top. A way to handle online tutorials would then be to either list the ones with no date in a separate list, or to have a way to say that it is a tutorial online or IRL and then separate them based on this. At least somehow we need to be able to sort tutorials in a good way!
