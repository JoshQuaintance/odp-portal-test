#  Imporvements to main page


__Title:__ Main page could be improved


__Description:__ Currently the Main Page contains a lot of textual explanations about the user roles, the "life-cycle" of an ODP (proposed, reviewed,catalogued) as well as the process model of managing these ODP's. This is all nice but makes the page feel quite cluttered.


Would it be possible to represent this information in a nice diagram and provide the detailed textual description in a separate page?
