#  Improving feedback mechanism


__Title:__ It is not clear how to submit a feedback


__Description:__ When filling in a feedback form, there is no "Save" button. It took me some time to figure out that this is hidden in the "Add another" button, and that I need to fill in something in the answer field before I can submit the feedback. This should really be changed if you want people to send their feedbacks.
