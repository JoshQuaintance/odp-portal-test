#  Submitted /last updated time shown in pattern summary and listings


__Title:__ Submitted /last updated time shown in pattern summary and listings


__Description:__ When perusing the portal for patterns for a particular use case, I find that it would have been helpful to sort the patterns by the most recently update or submitted ones. This could given an indication of which patterns are maintained and which patterns seem to be deprecated/forgotten. Or, in another perspective, it could indicate which patterns are new to the portal and which are more established. Either way, it seems to me to be a useful feature. 


For an example where this could have been useful, see Topic and SimpleTopic, the latter of which shares an author with the former but has essentially no content apart from a reusable owl building block and an intent text. My guess is that the latter may be an earlier version that has been abandoned in preference of the former, as the former is much more documented. Having to click into the history of both to compare them is a bit unintuitive if one is not used to this type of wiki. Also, the date in the history tab is the time the pattern page was last updated, whereas I guess what would be more useful to me is when the reusable owl building block was last updated.
