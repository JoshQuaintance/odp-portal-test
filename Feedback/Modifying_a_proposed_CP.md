#  Modifying a proposed CP


__Title:__ Modifying a proposed CP


__Description:__ It is possible that a user goes to [http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/index.php/Submissions:ProposeCP](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/index.php/Submissions:ProposeCP "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/index.php/Submissions:ProposeCP") to modify an existent CP instead of to create a new one. In this case it might be useful to provide the list of proposed CP in order to avoid possible mistakes typing the name of the CP being wanted to change. In this way, moreover, the users do not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another.


This idea also is applicable to the field “Image File Name” providing a mechanism to choice the desired image among those available instead of have to remember de exactly file name.
