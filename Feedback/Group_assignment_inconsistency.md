#  Group assignment inconsistency


__Title:__ Group assignment inconsistency


__Description:__ When you assign a person to the group "QualityCommittee" he appears in the list for review assignment (the drop-down box) but he is not listed in the category page and there is no note about his membership if you list users. For WOP we had to assign a bunch of people to the Quality Committee just to be able to assign them reviews, I am not sure that they should be there permanently so for the moment this might actually be very appropriate, but in principle this is an error/inconsistency.
