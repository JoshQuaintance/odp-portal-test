#  Ontology Overview


#  Long Description


The GoodRelations ontology provides a conceptual model for a consolidated view on commerce data on the Web, e.g., companies, store locations, offers, product descriptions, pricing,
payment, shipment, and warranty information. Since its official
release in August 2008, it has gained substantial popularity and is
supported by e.g. Yahoo and BestBuy. At the time of writing,
there are more than 1,5 million non-toy product model
descriptions, 450k individual offers with price information, and 50
k company profiles available. In addition, the popular RDF Book
Mashup1 now exposes Amazon and eBay offers of new and used
copies for more than 100k book titles as GoodRelations data.


In an extremely short space of time (approx a year) this ontology has already seen significant commercial use. There is a good possibility that this will revolutionize E-commerce and become the killer application for the semantic web.
