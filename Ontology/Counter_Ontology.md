#  Ontology Overview


#  Long Description


The Counter Ontology includes a general multiple purpose counter concept. This concept could be uses to associate any concept to a co:Counter instance(s) with the property co:counter or a specific sub property of it. The second property of co:Counter is co:count, which is a simple xsd:integer based datatype property. That means you could use this concept for things like for example play counter, skip counter or website hit counter.
Furthermore, this ontology includes already a predefined property to associate event specific ( event:Event) counter to its related events (co:event\_counter,), e.g. a co:ScrobbleEvent to scrobble something. This enables the opportunity to trace back all related events, which are responsible for a specific count. Of course, this is also possible with all other conceptsÂ ;)
