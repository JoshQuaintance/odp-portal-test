#  Ontology Overview


#  Long Description


Functional groups are described by patterns of atomic connectivity which exhibit characteristic chemical reactivity in compounds that contain them. Being able to identify such compounds is important to both synthetic and medicinal chemistry and for drug discovery.
This collection of OWL ontologies makes possible the classification of compounds based on the presence of acyclic functional groups using an OWL reasoner. The presence of functional group is inferred from the chemical structure, defined in terms of atoms and the bonds they share.
