#  Ontology Overview


#  Long Description


The Info Service Ontology consists of a basic is:InfoService concept (which could maybe related to prv:DataProvidingService, bibo:Collection, sioc:Space or void:Dataset instances) and some additional ones for describing such an information service (currently: is:InfoServiceQuality, is:InfoServiceType and is:InfoServiceContributorType â€“ the specific individuals are currently only proof-of-concept examples).


The main hook re. specific websites from an information service is is:info\_service, which associates an is:InfoService instance to e.g. a owl:Thing (or e.g. sub class of owl:Thing, e.g. foaf:Document) instance (e.g. a website link).


Furthermore, I defined some is:InfoService individuals, especially isi:musicbrainz (see the graphic above and code below) as proof-of-concept example. Therefore, I used also some category definitions from DBpedia (important is also the property is:main\_subject for associating a main subject of an Information Service).
