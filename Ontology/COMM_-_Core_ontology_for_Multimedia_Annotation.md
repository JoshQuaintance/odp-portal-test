#  Ontology Overview


#  Long Description


In order to retrieve and reuse non-textual media, media annotations must explain how a media object is composed of its parts and what the parts represent. Annotations need to link to background knowledge found in existing knowledge sources and to the creation and use of the media object. The representation and understanding of such facets of the media semantics is made possible through a formal language and a corresponding ontology. COMM is based on a careful analysis of the requirements underlying the semantic representation of media objects. It goes beyond the capabilities of most semantic multimedia ontologies. COMM was built by re-engineering MPEG-7. It leverages components from the DOLCE foundational ontology to support conceptual clarity and soundness as well as extensibility towards new annotation requirements.
