#  Ontology Overview


#  Long Description


Event-Model-F is a formal model of events designed to facilitate interoperability in distributed event-based systems. The model is based on the foundational ontology DOLCE+DnS Ultralite (DUL) and provides comprehensive support to represent time and space, objects and persons, as well as mereological, causal, and correlative relationships between events. In addition, the Event-Model-F provides a fexible means for event composition, modeling event causality and event correlation, and representing di�erent interpretations of the same event. The Event-Model-F is developed following the pattern-oriented approach of DUL, is modularized in di�erent ontologies, and can be easily extended by domain speci�c ontologies.
