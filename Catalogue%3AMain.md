This area is dedicated to the ODP official Catalogue of  [Ontology Design Patterns](Category/OntologyDesignPattern "Category:OntologyDesignPattern").


Each pattern is presented as a catalogue entry and has passed a quality check step before its publishing. 


The quality check is performed by one or more members of the  [Quality Committee](QualityCommittee "QualityCommittee") who are in charge of evaluating each Content OP against a set of  [evaluation principles](Odp/EvaluationPrinciples "Odp:EvaluationPrinciples").
