#  List Patterns: link inconsistency


__Title:__ List Patterns: link inconsistency


__Description:__ On the front page there is a link called "List Patterns", a similar link is present in the menu on the left, but they do not lead to the same page, why? This seems like an error. Either the links need to be named differently so that a user does not expect to get to the same page, or they need to point to the same page. I would suggest to keep the page that is linked from the left menu, and just add any missing explanatory text there that is present in the other page.
