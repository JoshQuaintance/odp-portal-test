#  Data type values in DOLCE


__Title:__ Data type properties


__Description:__ It happens often that some entity has attributes that are simply strings, an array of characters like the title of a book or the name of a person. It is not clear what pattern should be used in DOLCE (also DUL) in these cases. In a pattern it is suggested to use the data type property dul:hasDataValue to attach a value to an instance, but that should mean that, for a dul:Person, a Name class must be created in advance related to the dul:Person. Another pattern suggests to use dul:Region but it seems quite awkward for names, last names etc. that are not defined in a dimensional space. In the case in which there are too many possible values and we are not interested to link these values to another object it is allowed to use simple data type properties.
