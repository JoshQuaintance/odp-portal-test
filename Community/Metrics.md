#  Metrics


__Title:__ Metrics


__Description:__ This problem originates from the work of the [W3C Decision Incubator group](http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/decision/wiki/Main_Page "http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/decision/wiki/Main_Page"). However, the problem could be applicable to other areas than decision-making.


The problem concerns how to model metrics that can be applied in decision-making situations. A metric is a way to assess options, to make a decision. If a metric is formally described, it can be better understood, reused, and in some cases applied automatically. We would also like to be able to detect possible metrics automatically, i.e., given a dataset we would like to be able to determine what metrics could be applied to it.
