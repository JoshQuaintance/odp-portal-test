#  Ordered Lists


__Title:__ Ordered Lists


__Description:__ This problem originates from the W3C Decision Incubator activity, however it is not restricted to the decision-making domain, but more general. 


The problem is how to best represent ordered lists in RDF/OWL. In the decision representation domain the problem arises when modeling options, where one of the options will be selected, i.e., it will be the decision.


RDF contains native constructs for sets and lists. There are also some proposals for OWL models of sets and lists to be found at [http://swan.mindinformatics.org/spec/1.2/collections.html](http://swan.mindinformatics.org/spec/1.2/collections.html "http://swan.mindinformatics.org/spec/1.2/collections.html") What would be the best way to model this?
