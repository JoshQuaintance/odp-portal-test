#  Causal information and proportionality


__Title:__ Causal information and proportionality
__Description:__ Consider the following paragraph:
The logistics of carrying out metabolism set limits on cell size. 
Metabolic requirements also impose upper limits on the size that is practical for a single cell. As an object of a particular shape increases in size, its volume grows proportionately more than its surface area. Metabolic requirements also impose upper limits on the size that is practical for a single cell. As an object of a particular shape increases in size, its volume grows proportionately more than its surface area. Thus, the smaller the object, the greater its ratio of surface area to volume. A high surface-to-volume ratio facilitates the exchange of materials between a cell and its environment.
