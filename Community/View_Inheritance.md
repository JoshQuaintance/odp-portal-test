#  About


  




#  Additional information


After some time looking at this type of modeling problem, another domain that deals with this type of conceptual modelling scenario is "facet analisys" and "faceted classification" in Library Science.


It seems that there is a strong correlation across different disciplines regarding how they address the modeling problem presented here:



* "View Inheritance" in Object-Oriented Design (see page 824 of [Meyer, 2000]).
* The "polyhierarchies" or "semantic axes" refered to in the "Normalization Ontology Design Pattern" in Ontology Design [Rector, 2003][Normalization ODP].
* "Facet Analysis" and "Facetted Classification" in Library Science. See example on how to model the concept of "dish detergent" in [Denton, 2003].
