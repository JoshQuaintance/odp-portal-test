##   General topics


Web ontology design. Use of existing tools and requirements for new
tools supporting ontology design. Web ontology design.



##   Target audience


PhD, and PhD students in Computer Science, Information Technology, Computer
Engineering, Mathematics, Logics, Philosophy, Computational
Linguistics, and other disciplines that employ or might be considering
employing techniques and theories connected with the semantic
technologies with particolar focus on Semantic Web technologies.
Master students in the above mentioned disciplines who are developing
a master thesis or plan to be enrolled in a PhD course on these
arguments.



##   Program


Computational ontologies: what they are and how to use them. Languages
for ontologies: First Order Logic, Description Logics, and differences
with software engineering-oriented languages (eg: UML, E/R). The
Semantic Web language stack: RDF and OWL. Existing tools which support
OWL-RDF: exercises. Components of ontology design: CODO, ODM. Brief
introduction on linguistic frames. Pattern-based ontology design.
Limits of existing tools in terms of support for modular design of
ontologies. Research issues and challenges.



##   Final evaluation


Students are required to develop a small project and will be organized
in small teams. Projects will include the realization of an OWL
ontology by applying pattern-based ontology design. The ontology has
to be formalized by using the tools presented during the course. The
use of such tools will allow students to test and evaluate them.


Projects can be about either the design of a specific ontology for a
given domain or for a given computational/business task (e.g., a model
for public administration, healthy system, multimedia management, etc)
or the use of ontologies for a specific service.


Students evaluation will be based on checking the knowledge they
acquired about topics discussed during the course. Particular
attention will be given to the projects that will be developed in the
course.
