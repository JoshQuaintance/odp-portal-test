#  Additional information


Recommendation is the subject of recommender systems, which "form or work from a specific type of information filtering system technique that attempts to recommend information items (movies, TV program/show/episode, video on demand, [music](../Community/Music "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Community:Music"), books, news, images, web pages, scientific literature such as research papers etc.) that are likely to be of interest to the user.


Typically, a recommender system compares a [user profile](../Community/Personalization "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Community:Personalization") to some reference characteristics, and seeks to predict the 'rating' that a user would give to an item they had not yet considered. These characteristics may be from the information item (the content-based approach) or the user's social environment (the collaborative filtering approach)." (see [Recommender System @ Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system")).
