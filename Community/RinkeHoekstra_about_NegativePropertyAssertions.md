__[RinkeHoekstra](../User/RinkeHoekstra.md "User:RinkeHoekstra") about [NegativePropertyAssertions](../Submissions/NegativePropertyAssertions.md "Submissions:NegativePropertyAssertions") (Revision ID: [5903](../Submissions/NegativePropertyAssertions@oldid=5903.md "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:NegativePropertyAssertions?oldid=5903"))__
Overall suggestion (score): -1 - reject




 __Review Summary:__ The author of this pattern fails to mention that the negative property assertions of OWL 2 are purely syntactic sugar for exactly the pattern he describes. 
They are explicitly introduced in OWL 2 in e.g. the new features and rationale document.


In conclusion, this pattern may be useful to users sticking with OWL 1 (although I have no idea why they would want to), and as such can be a valuable contribution to this wiki. However, it would be wrong to attribute it to the current author (though he should receive credit for making it available on the wiki).
