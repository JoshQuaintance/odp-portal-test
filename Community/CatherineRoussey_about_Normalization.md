Overall suggestion (score): 1 - needs minor revision




 __Review Summary:__ This pattern is very usefull when you want to validate a classification and make some modifications.
In the cell ontology, I have downloaded from the ODP portal, there is no disjointness relationships. But in the description on the modularization process, the author mentions "making primitive siblings disjoint". Thus, it is not easy to understand which the disjoint siblings are ... Could you modify the example and add disjointness relationships.



Moreover what happens when the ontology is too big to allow a reasoner to infere the new classification ... Maybe a scenario may be proposed in order to explain how to validate part of a huge classification... To my point of view the infered subClassOf relationship may be saved for manual research... You can image to save two versions of the same classification, the one to validate the classification (this one can be used for modification) and another one that save a version of the classification in a validate state. This version will be usefull for manual research without reasoner.
