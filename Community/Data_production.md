#  Data production


__Title:__ Data Production


__Description:__ I would need to describe the following pattern:
"A device/sensor/software application produces a piece of data (e.g., a measure for a sensor, a computation for an application).


More generally, how to describe the information producer/consumer model?

Solution Ideas: With respect to DOLite Description and Situation, I subclasse data from information-object. Is it correct to create an immediate-relation between agent(?) and data, called "produces"? Do we need to ascribe an agentive nature to the particular that produces data? This might not always be the case if we think of sensor platforms.
