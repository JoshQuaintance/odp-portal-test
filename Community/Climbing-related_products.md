__Title:__ Issues in modeling climbing-related products


__Description:__ The goal is to build a web application that tracks safety information about products typically used in bouldering, rock climbing, alpinism, and mountaineering. Generally speaking, products in this domain are highly specialized and technical in nature. The ability to model failure points in individuals - eg, "My harness broke at the belay loop" (potentially deadly) versus "My harness broke at the gear loop" (potentially inconvenient) - is an important capability.


The model must support effective inferencing, though possibly from specialized reasoners. The model must also take into account the myriad attributes that can be associated with different product classes: sizing, gender, year of production, weight, materials, etc, etc.
