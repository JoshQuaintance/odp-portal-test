#   [Submissions](../Submissions/Main "Submissions:Main")


This area aims at collecting Ontology Design Pattern proposals from ODP users.


After the author has finished the submission and asked for a review, the proposals are assigned to at least two members of the ODP Quality Committee,
who are expected to provide a review. 


Positive reviews can be accompanied with guidelines for fixing possible problems of the proposed Content OP.


Once such problems have been addressed, the proposed Content OP can be certified and published in the  [official catalogue](../Catalogue/Main "Catalogue:Main").


See the submissions list:



* [Content ODPs](../Submissions/ContentOPs "Submissions:ContentOPs")
* [Reengineering ODPs](../Submissions/ReengineeringODPs "Submissions:ReengineeringODPs")
* [Alignment ODPs](../Submissions/AlignmentODPs "Submissions:AlignmentODPs")
* [Logical ODPs](../Submissions/LogicalODPs "Submissions:LogicalODPs")
* [Architectural ODPs](../Submissions/ArchitecturalODPs "Submissions:ArchitecturalODPs")
* [Lexico-Syntactic ODPs](../Submissions/LexicoSyntacticODPs "Submissions:LexicoSyntacticODPs")


  




#   [Catalogue](../Catalogue/Main "Catalogue:Main")


This area is dedicated to the ODP official Catalogue of  [Ontology Design Patterns](../Category/OntologyDesignPattern "Category:OntologyDesignPattern").


Each pattern is presented as a catalogue entry and has passed a quality check step before its publishing. 


The quality check is performed by one or more members of the  [Quality Committee](../QualityCommittee "QualityCommittee") who are in charge of evaluating each Content OP against a set of  [evaluation principles](../Odp/EvaluationPrinciples "Odp:EvaluationPrinciples").
