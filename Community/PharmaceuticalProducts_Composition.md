#  PharmaceuticalProducts Composition


__Title:__ Pharmaceutical Product Composition


__Description:__ The pharmaceutical products or drugs are chemical products composed by a set of ingredients (substances).


The ingredients are substances in a concrete dosage. 
The ingredients are divided in one main ingredient (mainly an active ingredient) and a set of excipients (other substances)
The drugs are uniques based on their concrete composition. 


I checked the Parts and Collections patterns, but I'm not pretty sure to use the Composition or Constituency in this case

#  About


  




#  Additional information


In this case, we propose a solution based on:




```
 - One Pharma Product has one composition
 - the Composition has different ingredients
 - each ingredient is a substance with a concrete dosage

```

So, ingredients are part of Compositions which are related to a concrete pharmaceutical product
