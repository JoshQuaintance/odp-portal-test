##  Abstract


In this paper we present a Linguistic Meta-Model (LMM) allowing a semiotic-cognitive representation of knowledge. LMM is freely
available and integrates the schemata of linguistic knowledge resources, such as WordNet and FrameNet, as well as foundational ontologies,
such as DOLCE and its extensions. In addition, LMM is able to deal with multilinguality and to represent individuals and facts in
an open domain perspective.
