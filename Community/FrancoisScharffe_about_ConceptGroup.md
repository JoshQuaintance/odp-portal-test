Overall suggestion (score): 0 - needs major revision




 __Review Summary:__ This pattern is meant to be used to represent group memberships of concepts. Sub and super groups can be represented, and both extensional (declared) and intensional (according to a property) memberships can be modeled. 
The pattern seems interesting but present many shadowed areas. I can deduce from the usage of the terms concept ans broader/narrower relations that this pattern is to be used together with the SKOS vocabulary. If this is the case this should be made explicit. Otherwise, what is the relation of this pattern with owlÂ ?
I lack an example instantiation of the pattern.
The Solution Description contains questions ... Questions are no solutions...



In summary I think it is an interesting pattern which could certainly find applications when publishing terminologies with SKOS. The pattern however needs to be better described. This pattern can definitely lead to interesting discussions.
