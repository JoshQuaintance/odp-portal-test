__Goal__:


The goal of the tutorial is to enable participants in getting basic-to-average competences (with a glimpse to advanced) about: extracting, reengineering, designing, linking, querying/reasoning on knowledge with reference to Semantic Web and Linked Data content, data, and best practices. Examples will be preferentially taken from the legal domain.


__Brief description__


The current bootstrapping of open data, public administration data, semantic technologies (in particular at the interface between Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering) involves or requires legal knowledge. 
However, traditional practices of modelling and reasoning need to be adapted when we consider the broad, heterogeneous, and peculiar context provided by the Web (in its documental, social, linked, semantic, and dynamic aspects).


The intended audience includes AI&Law practicioners that need an introduction to the current trends and practices in the analysis, representation, and practical manipulation of knowledge and semantics on/from the Web.


The tutorial is designed for a full-day, and consists in short lectures, accompanied by web browsing, use of web applications and APIs, and hands-on exercises on either paper or tools.


Schedule


– Introduction to semantic technologies and ontology editing tools (lecture with hands-on session)


– Ontology design patterns for the legal domain (lecture with hands-on session)


– The Apache Stanbol platform for practical data and ontology design (lecture with hands-on session)


– Knowledge extraction tools for ontology and data design (lecture with hands-on session)
