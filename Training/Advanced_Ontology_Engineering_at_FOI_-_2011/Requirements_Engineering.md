* __Context:__


An online music database wishes to semantically represent their data about musicians, albums, and performances, in order to be able to provide better search functions to their users, i.e. by querying the knowledge base instead of using keyword queries. 



* __User interface:__
	+ Search for songs and who has recorded/played a song
	+ Search for artists and bands and get information about them
	+ Visualize timeline of a band
	+ Browse genres of songs, band and artists
* __Take the following text and try to derive requirements from it (CQs + contextual statements & reasoning requirements):__


The current configuration of the “Red Hot Chili Peppers” are: Anthony Kiedis (vocals), Flea (bass, trumpet, keyboards, and vocals), John Frusciante (guitar), and Chad Smith (drums). The line-up has changed a few times during they years, Frusciante replaced Hillel Slovak in 1988, and when Jack Irons left the band he was briefly replaced by D.H. Peligo until the band found Chad Smith. In addition to playing guitars for Red hot Chili Peppers Frusciante also contributed to the band “The Mars Volta” as a vocalist for some time. Red Hot Chili Peppers released the album “Stadium Arcadium” in 2006. It includes the song “Hump de Bump”, which was composed in January 2004. “Hump de Bump” is a punk rock song, but the band is also playing alternative rock, and hip hop on some records. The critic Crian Hiatt defined the album as "the most ambitious work in his twenty-three-year career".
