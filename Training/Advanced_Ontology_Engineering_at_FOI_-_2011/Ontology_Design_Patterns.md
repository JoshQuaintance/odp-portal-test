__Problem__:
Use the wiki pages of Content ODPs to find at least one ODP that solves the problem of each of the requirements below (see the "Task" section below). For each ODP you select, document _why_ you think this is a good solution, and describe briefly _how_ you would reuse (i.e. specialize) the ODP for your specific case.




__Solutions__:



* Solutions should be of the form: _CQ no. x, y can be solved by specializing the Content ODP named z._ Plus a motivation why this is the case and some ideas on how to use/specialize the ODP.
* _After the exercise is done_ you can check  [this page](../../Training/Advanced_Ontology_Engineering_at_FOI_-_2011/Ontology_Design_Patterns/Solution_Ideas.md "Training:Advanced Ontology Engineering at FOI - 2011/Ontology Design Patterns/Solution Ideas") for solution suggestions.


###  Task


__Context__


The national association for promotion of theater in Italy wants to set up a web-based system for keeping track of details about theater productions and the actors at different theaters. In order to support reasoning about the productions, the system should be based on an ontology. Below are some typical situations that should be representable in the ontology, and requirements in the form of competency questions and contextual statements.


  

__Story: theater productions__


During each year a number of theatre festivals are held in cities around Italy. In January 2007 a festival called “Roma Loves Shakespeare” took place in Rome. Two different productions of “The Merchant of Venice” participated, one from a theatre in Pisa and the other from a theatre institute in Venice, featuring an ensemble of university art students. Other plays were Othello and a Midsummer Night’s Dream. 


The Grand Theatre in Rome offers two theatre shows each evening during September and October 2009. The play set up in this period is the "Merchant of Venice",given through an ensemble of well-known Italian actors. The Merchant of Venice was written during 1596 to 1598 by William Shakespeare, and it has 5 distinct acts. The premier of this production at The Grand Theatre was on September 7. Il Gazzettino gave the setup of the play 5 stars in a recent review.


Fabio Bianchi is an Italian actor employed at the theatre since May 2004, he is a part of the ensemble setting up the Merchant of Venice and he plays the Duke of Venice but also a servant in one of the scenes. During the second and third week of September the role of Shylock is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger as a special guest actor.
