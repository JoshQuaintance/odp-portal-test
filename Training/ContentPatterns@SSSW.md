__Goal__:


To make trainees able to design an ontology by reusing content patterns.


__Brief description__


The trainees attend a lecture of about 1 hour on ontology design patterns and pattern-based ontology design. After that, they experience pattern-based ontology design in the special case of reusing content patterns. Starting from a set of competency questions they have to find the matching content patterns, select, specialize and compose them in order to produce a networked ontology addressing their requirements i.e. the competency questions.
