__Problem__:
Develop an OWL ontology starting from the below use-case. Note that the text is only there to help you understand the domain and the context of the ontology, but the actual modelling requirements are the competency questions and the contextual statement. __In this exercise you should reuse some Content ODPs, in order to get used to them and understand the modelling issues they represent.__ You can find the ODPs at [this page.](../../../Submissions/ContentOPs "Submissions:ContentOPs")




```
  __Important:__ Your model should be within OWL-DL. Treat the CQs and the contextual statement as the requirements 
  of your model. The result of your modelling should represent these, but also conform to the 
  modelling "best practices" that have been taught in the course, e.g. appropriate naming of concepts.
  This time, in addition, you should reuse minimum one Content ODP!

__Context__


The national association for promotion of theater in Italy wants to set up a web-based system for keeping track of details about theater productions and the actors at different theaters. In order to support reasoning about the productions, the system should be based on an ontology. Below are some typical situations that should be representable in the ontology, and requirements in the form of competency questions and contextual statements.


  

__Story: theater productions__


During each year a number of theatre festivals are held in cities around Italy. In January 2007 a festival called “Roma Loves Shakespeare” took place in Rome. Two different productions of “The Merchant of Venice” participated, one from a theatre in Pisa and the other from a theatre institute in Venice, featuring an ensemble of university art students. Other plays were Othello and a Midsummer Night’s Dream.


The Grand Theatre in Rome offers two theatre shows each evening during September and October 2009. The play set up in this period is the "Merchant of Venice",given through an ensemble of well-known Italian actors. The Merchant of Venice was written during 1596 to 1598 by William Shakespeare, and it has 5 distinct acts. The premier of this production at The Grand Theatre was on September 7. Il Gazzettino gave the setup of the play 5 stars in a recent review.


Fabio Bianchi is an Italian actor employed at the theatre since May 2004, he is a part of the ensemble setting up the Merchant of Venice and he plays the Duke of Venice but also a servant in one of the scenes. During the second and third week of September the role of Shylock is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger as a special guest actor.
