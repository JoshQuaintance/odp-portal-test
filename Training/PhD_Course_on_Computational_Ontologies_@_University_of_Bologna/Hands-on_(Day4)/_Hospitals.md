__Problem__:
Develop an OWL ontology starting from the below use-case. Note that the text is only there to help you understand the domain and the context of the ontology, but the actual modelling requirements are the competency questions (CQs) and the contextual statement. In this exercise you do not _have to_ reuse [Content ODPs](../../../Submissions/ContentOPs.md "Submissions:ContentOPs"), but please use patterns if you find them useful.




```
  __Important:__ Your model should be within OWL-DL. Treat the CQs and the contextual statement as the 
  requirements of your model. The result of your modelling should support these, but also conform to 
  the modelling "best practices" that have been taught in the course, e.g. appropriate naming of concepts.

__Context__


A European federation of unions in the medial care field wants to track the activities and members of union groups at hospitals in different European countries. One particular use case is to be able to study what kind of medical research is going on at the different hospitals, and how the nurses and doctors with different backgrounds update their knowledge and continue to learn while practicing at the hospital. Below is an example of what they typically would like to store, and at the bottom you find the competency questions developed as requirements for the ontology.


  

__Story: unions and medical research__


Pasquale Di Gennaro first studied to become a nursing assistant, but after working some years he decided to continue studying to become a certified nurse. He took his degree in May 2001. On September 21 (2001) he was employed at Ospedale Riunito delle Tre Valli in the city of Nocera Inferiore (IT). In the hospital there are different unions organising the staff. Pasquale Di Gennaro has been the union representative for male nurses at Ospedale Riunito delle Tre Valli from 2002. Senior doctors regularly evaluate all employees working with patient care, and these written statements are stored for future reference.


To constantly update their knowledge both nurses and doctors read research articles that can be found in article collections at the hospital library. Article collections are usually available both as books and electronically, on CDs or in other formats. In 2008 an article collection entitled “Nurse practices in cancer patient care – longitudinal studies at Italian hospitals” was published as a book. The collection contains an article by Pasquale Di Gennaro, entitled “A 5 year-program for improving cancer care – experiences and future directions”. In total the book version of this collection has 346 pages. For discussing new articles Italian hospitals regularly hold seminars where a number of articles are presented. In December 2008 such a seminar was held in Nocera Inferiore at Ospedale Riunito delle Tre Valli.
