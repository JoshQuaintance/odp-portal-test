Modelling exercise done in pairs.


__Context__


A European federation of unions in the medial care field wants to track the activities and members of union groups at hospitals in different European countries. One particular use case is to be able to study what kind of medical research is going on at the different hospitals, and how the nurses and doctors with different backgrounds update their knowledge and continue to learn while practicing at the hospital. Below is an example of what they typically would like to store, and at the bottom you find the comeptency questions developed as requirements for the ontology.


  

__Story: unions and medical research__


Pasquale Di Gennaro first studied to become a nursing assistant, but after working some years he decided to continue studying to become a certified nurse. He took his degree in May 2001. On September 21 (2001) he was employed at Ospedale Riunito delle Tre Valli in the city of Nocera Inferiore (IT). In the hospital there are different unions organising the staff. Pasquale Di Gennaro has been the union representative for male nurses at Ospedale Riunito delle Tre Valli from 2002. Senior doctors regularly evaluate all employees working with patient care, and these written statements are stored for future reference.


To constantly update their knowledge both nurses and doctors read research articles that can be found in article collections at the hospital library. Article collections are usually available both as books and electronically on CDs. In 2008 an article collection entitled “Nurse practices in cancer patient care – longitudinal studies at Italian hospitals” was published as a book. The book contains an article by Pasquale Di Gennaro, entitled “A 5 year-program for improving cancer care – experiences and future directions”. In total the book version of this collection has 346 pages. For discussing new articles Italian hospitals regularly hold seminars where a number of articles are presented. In December 2008 such a seminar was held in Nocera Inferiore at Ospedale Riunito delle Tre Valli.
