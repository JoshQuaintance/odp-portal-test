__Goal__:


To make participants able to develop ontologies from requirements to design, to evaluation by using NeOn technologies.


__Brief description__


This training course is design for 3 days training, and focuses on NeOn technologies. The content can be described in terms of three main slots:
(i) a general introduction to semantic technologies and ontology design, to the languages used for representing data and ontologies (RDF and OWL); and to NeOn methodologies and tools; (ii) the pattern-based approach to ontology design in OWL; (iii) a mini-project in which participants, divided into groups, will move from requirements to design and evaluation.
