__Problem__:
The first steps of the iteration of a design pair in XD deals with requirements engineering, i.e. creating the CQs. In this small exercise we will create some CQs based on a story. The context introduces the setting of the ontology development project that you should assume to be working on. In a real project, you would then agree on the CQs and contextual statement with the customer before proceeding. Your task now is to create a set of CQs covering the small story! If you have time left, try to imagine how you would model a specific CQ and write a SPARQL query that could be used on the model to test if you fulfill that CQ or not. What is the query and what should the expected result be? 


  

__Context__


An online music database wishes to semantically represent their data about musicians, albums, and performances, in order to be able to provide better search functions to their users, i.e. by querying the knowledge base instead of using keyword queries. Below is an example of what they typically would like to store, and at the bottom you find the competency questions developed as requirements for the ontology.


  

__Story: music and bands__


The current configuration of the “Red Hot Chili Peppers” are: Anthony Kiedis (vocals), Flea (bass, trumpet, keyboards, and vocals), John Frusciante (guitar), and Chad Smith (drums). The line-up has changed a few times during they years, Frusciante replaced Hillel Slovak in 1988, and when Jack Irons left the band he was briefly replaced by D.H. Peligo until the band found Chad Smith. In addition to playing guitars for Red hot Chili Peppers Frusciante also contributed to the band “The Mars Volta” as a vocalist for some time.


From September 2004, the Red Hot Chili Peppers started recording the album “Stadium Arcadium”. The album contains 28 tracks and was released on May 5 2006. It includes a track of the song “Hump de Bump”, which was composed in January 26, 2004. The critic Crian Hiatt defined the album as "the most ambitious work in his twenty-three-year career". On August 11 (2006) the band gave a live performance in Portland, Oregon (US), featuring songs from Stadium Arcadium and other albums.
