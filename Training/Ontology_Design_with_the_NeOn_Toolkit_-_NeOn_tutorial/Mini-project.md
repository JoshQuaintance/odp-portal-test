__Problem__:
The context of the mini-project is FAO fish stock monitoring, however the stories used are modified to include appropriate modeling issues (and may thereby not be an accurate description of reality). The participants should use their own common sense while modeling, as well as treating the trainers as the customers, i.e. they can be asked for clarification.


The participants will be divided into three groups, each group divides its participants internally into pairs. Negotiate solutions between modelling pairs, but also consider that tasks (stories) may be overlapping and that solutions and ideas should be discussed between the three groups. Further instructions are given in the session. 



* Story - Group 1


The Skipjack Tuna generally has an epipelagic habitat on less than 50m depth, and one specific resource of Skipjack Tuna can be found in water area 34. The Skipjack Tuna eats molluscs and is eaten by the Striped Marlin. The resource of Skipjack Tuna at pelagic depth in water area 34 was in 2004 observed to have the exploitation rate "moderate fishing mortality" and the exploitation state "fully exploited". The observation was made by Field Research Unit 3, which was at that time was headed by Fabio Bianchi and additionally contained the observers Aldo Gangemi and Alfio Gliozzo. Fabio is also working as a research engineer at FAO headquarters since 2002, and will in 2010 move to head a new FAO branch in Argentina responsible for fish stock monitoring in South America and the Caribbean. 



* Story - Group 2


The Skipjack Tuna generally has an epipelagic habitat on less than 50m depth. It lives in the tropical climatic zone and has an abundance level of "low abundance". The Skipjack Tuna is usually caught by using trawls. The ship Landsort is a trawler. Trawlers can normally be equipped with both trawls and gillnets. Bottom gillnets are commonly used in water area 34 and 31 and regular gillnets are commonly used in water areas 34, 31, and 17, by several different vessle types. Landsort has a crew of 10 people. During January 2009 the ship was operating in water area 34 but she is registered in Civitavecchia (IT). From 2008 the captain of Landsort is Claudio Baldassarre, and since 2008-09-10 an FAO observer also works on board Landsort, her name is Teodora Presutti, and she is currently responsible for fish stock monitoring in the EU and the Micronesian region. During one mission in January 2009 Teodora was replaced by Fabio Bianchi.



* Story - Group 3


The Skipjack Tuna is a fish species accidentally caught by gillnets, but is usually caught by using trawls. Dolphins on the other hand are accidentally caught by trawls. During 2007 to 2009 the use of trawls was forbidden in water areas 21 and 34, since the Skipjack Tuna at this time had the conservation status "vulnerable". However, the use of gillnets is generally not allowed in the Polynesian and Caribbean regions or by the Arab Maghreb Union. Gillnets are commonly used in water areas 34, 31, and 17, by several different vessle types. The resource of Skipjack Tuna at pelagic depth in water area 34, was in 2004 observed to have the exploitation rate "moderate fishing mortality" and the exploitation state "fully exploited". Field Research Unit 3 is an FAO observation unit that during 2004 operated from two different trawlers in water areas 34 and 37. At this time the unit was headed by Fabio Binachi, but in 2006 he was replaced by Anders Andersson.
