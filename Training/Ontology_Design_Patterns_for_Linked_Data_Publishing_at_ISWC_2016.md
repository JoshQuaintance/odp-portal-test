__Goal__:


To offer support to a continuously growing community of researchers and practitioners interested in Ontology Design patterns by way of a combination of lectures and practical work.


__Brief description__


The tutorial starts with an introduction to ODPs, including fundamentals and definitions, which are discussed based on the presentation of concrete examples. During this slot, the most popular and reused ODPs are presented and explained. After learning the fundamentals and the most popular ODPs, the attendees will learn how ODPs are documented, and they will be trained on how to evaluate, select and reuse ODPs. This theoretical part of the tutorial is run during the first half of the morning session. The second half of the morning is dedicated to the analysis of worked examples. The attendees are presented with a "toy" example developed within the "chess" domain, useful for making them familiar with the whole process of ODP-based ontology design. Afterwards, they are presented with examples of ODP reuse from real scenarios, implemented in open data projects in several domains, such as Cultural Heritage and eGovernment. Lessons learnt and specific ODP implementations and their related linked data production, will be discussed. All slots are meant to be very interactive. In the afternoon session, the attendees are engaged in a practical session on ODP-based design, after a brief introduction to a Protégé plugin for ODP-based design that is provided for technical support. Attendees are required to have prior knowledge of RDF and OWL.

##   Tutorial Schedule


__Room 504, starting 9am__



###   Morning


1. __Introduction to ODPs__ - Aldo Gangemi (~30 mins including 10 mins of questions)  
In this talk ODPs fundamentals and definitions are introduced by means of concrete examples of most popular and commonly used ODPs. ([slides (pdf))](http://www.slideshare.net/gangemi/ontology-design-patterns-for-linked-data-tutorial-at-iswc2016-introduction "http://www.slideshare.net/gangemi/ontology-design-patterns-for-linked-data-tutorial-at-iswc2016-introduction")
2. __How to document and evaluate/choose ODPs__ - Karl Hammar (~30 min including 10 mins of questions)  
This section introduces a set of quality characteristics and associated indicators for ODPs. The provided indicators can be used to evaluate the maturity and quality of an ODP and its suitability for different modelling projects or cases, as well as provide guidance on how to construct and/or document new patterns. ([slides (pdf)](../images/5/5b/ISWC_2016_Tutorial_-_Documenting_and_evaluating_ODPs.pdf "ISWC 2016 Tutorial - Documenting and evaluating ODPs.pdf"))
3. __Methods to reuse ODPs__ - Valentina Presutti (~30 min including 10 mins of questions)  
This section is focused on methods for ontology reuse. In particular, three possible technical approaches will be presented and discussed, through a set of running examples. Strengths and weaknesses of these approaches are discussed. The goal is to make attendees aware of pros and cons of adopting a specific reuse approach, in the light of its impact on the ontology semantics and on its maintenance. ([slides (pdf))](http://www.slideshare.net/vpresutti/methods-for-ontology-design-patterns-reuse "http://www.slideshare.net/vpresutti/methods-for-ontology-design-patterns-reuse")
4. __Break__
5. __Worked examples__ (90 mins including 30 mins of questions)
	1. Examples in the Chess domain - Pascal Hitzler (~45 min)  
	In this section, we present a worked example which progresses from a use case description to the design of the corresponding pattern-based ontology. The example is taken from recent work (published e.g. at the COLD 2015 workshop) regarding the usefulness of ontology design patterns for linked data publishing. The scenario is that of chess data on the web; a website accompanies this part of the tutorial. ([slides (pdf)](http://www.pascal-hitzler.de/pub2/2016-10-ISWC-Tutorial-Hitzler.pdf "http://www.pascal-hitzler.de/pub2/2016-10-ISWC-Tutorial-Hitzler.pdf")) ([Website with supplementary material](http://dase.cs.wright.edu/content/pattern-driven-linked-data-publishing-primer "http://dase.cs.wright.edu/content/pattern-driven-linked-data-publishing-primer")) ([New ODP book site, including a 25% discount](../Odp/News/17 "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Odp:News/17"))
	2. Examples in CH and/or eGov - Giorgia Lodi (~45 min)  
	This talk proposes real examples of application of ODPs for ontologies defined in linked open data projects. In particular, the talk presents and discuss a number of use cases and lessons learnt from the cultural heritage, agriculture/fishery and smart cities contexts, with a focus on linked open datasets created on the base of the discussed ODPs. ([slides (pdf)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jbv70ym4uzxyfjf/TutorialExamplesODPsGL.pdf?dl=0 "https://www.dropbox.com/s/jbv70ym4uzxyfjf/TutorialExamplesODPsGL.pdf?dl=0"))


###   Afternoon


1. __Intro to WebProtégé XDP plugin__ - Karl Hammar (~15 min)  
XDP is a fork of WebProtégé that supports three main ODP usage steps: finding a suitable ODP, specialising that ODP for a particular modelling scenario, and aligning the resulting ODP specialisation with an existing ontology or ontology module. This section introduces XDP and demos its core functionality. ([Slides (PDF)](../images/d/d9/ISWC_2016_Tutorial_-_Introduction_to_XD_and_XDP.pdf "ISWC 2016 Tutorial - Introduction to XD and XDP.pdf"))
2. __Hands-on__ - All tutors available for support (~2h30mins)  
In this section, attendees practice creating an ontology by reusing ODPs with the support of XDP, starting from a set of requirements. They go through the whole process of pattern-based ontology design. All tutors are present and available to help them in working out their exercise and for answering to their questions.
