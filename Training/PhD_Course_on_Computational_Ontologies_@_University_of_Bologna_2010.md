##   Detailed Program


The course is divided into the following modules that include both lectures and hands-on sessions.



###   Module 1: Semantic Technologies and Computational ontologies


* Introduction to semantic technologies, Semantic Web and computational ontologies.
* Semantic Web languages such as RDF, OWL, and SPARQL.
* Tools for ontology editing.
* Methodologies for, and principles of ontology design.


###   Module 2: Ontology design patterns


* Definition of ontology design pattern (ODP) and theoretical foundation.
* Types of ODP and detailed analysis of Logical, Correspondence, and Content ODPs.


###   Module 3: eXtreme Design (XD): ODP-based Methodology for ontology design


* Overview of XD and analogy with eXtreme Programming (XP).
* Ontology requirements and competency questions.
* Defining unit tests for ontologies.
* Matching requirements with ODPs and ODP selection.
* ODP specialization and composition.
* Collaboration and Integration issues.
* The XD tool.


###   Module 4: Project {Students’ Evaluation}


Students will be evaluated through a project assignment, that will be developed collaboratively and on-site, the last day of the course in a 8 hours session. They will apply the notions and experiences acquired during the course to a realistic scenario. The students will be organized as an ontology developing team according to the XD methodology. The team will be assigned with a set of requirements and will have to collaboratively develop an ontology based on those requirements. The tutors will act as customers and will advise the team on methodological issues.
The aim of the project is on one hand to evaluate the single students for the sake of the PhD curriculum, on the other hand to make them experience a realistic scenario, and further discuss open problems in the area.
