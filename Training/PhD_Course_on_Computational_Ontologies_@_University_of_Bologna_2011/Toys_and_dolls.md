__Problem__:
Design an ontology based on the following sentences:



* Dolls are a kind of toy
* Young women are young persons and female
* A young person cannot be both a young man and a young woman
* Young persons are either young men or young women
* Most famous dolls are Lenore and Emily
* Young women play with some doll
* Young women play with only most famous dolls
* Young men play with at least one toy
* Clara is a young woman
* Clara and Laura are different individuals
* Lalu is the same person as Laura
* To dress a toy is a special case of playing, where the toy is a doll
* Only Lenore is a doll having Emily as a doll. Minnie has Emily as a doll (hint: use owl:hasKey)
* Clara is sister of Lalu's, Lalu is daughter of Aldo's, therefore Clara is daughter of Aldo's
* Toy is a generic class
* Clara played with Emily only for one month


Then, complete the ontology by adding inverse, symmetric, and transitive properties.
