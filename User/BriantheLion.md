__Main motivation for joining ODP community:__ I'd like to build an ontology about climbing gear. The purpose of this ontology would be to track the failure rates of various commercially-available products. We'd like to make the ontology available in wiki format, but need to model the domain first. So far, we feel that we are going to need to work in OWL-Full, but were hoping that some help from ODP would help us get to OWL-DL.


__Possible main contribution to ODP community:__ To have some help to solve modeling problems

__Is expert of:__


  

__How did I know about ODP:__ surfing the web
