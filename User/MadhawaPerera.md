__Main motivation for joining ODP community:__ I think ontology design patterns are helpful in solving similar types of modeling problems in different domains. Even though there could be domain-specific knowledge and ontologies, we often see similar modules (core classes and relationships) which could bring redundancy if not handled properly. Thus, ODP makes modeling tasks easier while bringing the best practices of reusability and modularity into ontology engineering. I am happy to contribute with my expertise in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Augmented Reality (AR) /Virtual Reality domains to developed ODP in those areas.
