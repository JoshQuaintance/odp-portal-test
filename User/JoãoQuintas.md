__Main motivation for joining ODP community:__ I'm currently finishing my PhD where I've been working in the Human Machine Interaction domain. In the scope of my work I noticed that there is a lack of an ontology representation that captures the information associated with this domain. Therefore, part of my work is dedicated to propose an information model for Context-Aware Human Machine Interaction framework, using ontologies to improve integration and interoperability between different robotic system deployments. This is also interesting to explore the path towards cloud robotics applications. I'm interested in sharing the resources I'm working on, which might be useful to others working in the same field.


__Possible main contribution to ODP community:__ To have some help to solve modeling problems, To help other users to solve modeling problems
