__Main motivation for joining ODP community:__ As a major part of my Ph.D. research project, I have developed an ontology for Brain-Computer Interaction (BCI) data capture activities.



* Brain-Computer Interaction (BCI) Ontology registry in Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV): <[http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/vocabs/bci](http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/vocabs/bci "http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/vocabs/bci")>
* Namespace URI: <[https://w3id.org/BCI-ontology#](https://w3id.org/BCI-ontology# "https://w3id.org/BCI-ontology#")>


If possible, I'd like to submit our BCI-Ontology as an exemplary ontology.


Also, I would like to be more involved in this community and continue learning about all its available resources, especially regarding ODPs.


__Possible main contribution to ODP community:__ To have some help to solve modeling problems, To help other users to solve modeling problems


__Domains of interest:__



* [Brain-Computer Interaction (BCI)](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Special:AddData/Domain Form/Community:Brain-Computer_Interaction_%28BCI%29 "Community:Brain-Computer Interaction (BCI) (not yet written)")


__Is expert of:__


  

__How did I know about ODP:__ conference/public events, surfing the web
