__Main motivation for joining ODP community:__ I am currently working with semantic integration of event-driven applications in Business Process Management. More specifically, how to monitor business processes execution based on the events generated by the invoked applications. Ontology Patterns can be useful to represent different kinds of complex events, as well as event integration patterns (which can be useful to enhance the monitorability of choreographed business processes).
