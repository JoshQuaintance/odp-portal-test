__Main motivation for joining ODP community:__ I am an unaffiliated, independent #CitizenScientist and digital preservation historian based in Broomfield, Colorado USA doing applied research at the intersection of #DigitalHumanities & #CognitiveComputing as part of my post-cancer #PayItForward Bonus Rounds. I am a former executive consultant in IBM's Object Technology Practice where I was a lead in a skunkworks doing pattern-based metamodel-derived "executable business model" frameworks in Smalltalk. I am applying insights of this 1990's work to my development of the MAGAZINE #GTS (Ground-Truth Storage) format based on an ontological "stack" of #cidocCRM/FRBRoo/PRESSoo. I \_really\_ want to join this group and, hopefully, become a member of the ODP association. I have excellent domain professional references who are mentor/collaborators at PRImA (U. Salford), eTRAP (U. Gottingen), and LAREX (U. Wurzburg), etc. if needed. I am also a member of the #cidocCRM SIG among other Digital Humanities, cultural preservation, and citizen science organizations and/or professional networks (as part of my #PLN, personal learning network).


BTW, an image of my #DATeCH2017 poster is here: [https://1drv.ms/i/s!AtML1v0eUlpEgoAVgZdKQDW7kb3wgw](https://1drv.ms/i/s!AtML1v0eUlpEgoAVgZdKQDW7kb3wgw "https://1drv.ms/i/s!AtML1v0eUlpEgoAVgZdKQDW7kb3wgw"). I also served on the Program Committee (as a means -- provided by my PRImA/eTRAP mentors -- for my free access to the latest research papers in the domains of my interest).


Thank you for your consideration. 


Happy-Healthy Vibes,
