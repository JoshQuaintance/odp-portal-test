__Main motivation for joining ODP community:__ 1. I'm an (aspiring) Software Developer and have contributed (in a small part) to the (developing) ValueFlows [https://valueflo.ws/](https://valueflo.ws/ "https://valueflo.ws/") Ontology [https://w3id.org/lode/owlapi/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valueflows/valueflows/master/release-doc-in-process/all\_vf.TTL](https://w3id.org/lode/owlapi/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valueflows/valueflows/master/release-doc-in-process/all_vf.TTL "https://w3id.org/lode/owlapi/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valueflows/valueflows/master/release-doc-in-process/all_vf.TTL")
2. I've been asked a question [https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows/issues/603#issuecomment-573473824](https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows/issues/603#issuecomment-573473824 "https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows/issues/603#issuecomment-573473824") which requires me to do a mapping and comparison task.
3. The current topics are measurements & dimensions where (I believe) much has already been defined in foundational ontologies.
4. I'm currently stumbling around with my task and seeking to learn how I can proceed effectively.
5. I've found great value in applying the basic patterns to my (pubescent) software and I anticipate similar gains are possible with ontological patterns.
6. As well as me learning, I hope to pass my learnings on to the ValueFlows community.


__Possible main contribution to ODP community:__ To have some help to solve modeling problems
