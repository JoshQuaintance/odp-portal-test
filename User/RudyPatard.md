__Main motivation for joining ODP community:__ Integrate LCA related ontologies in my work. Interaction with [Submissions:LCA Pattern](../Submissions/LCA_Pattern.md "Submissions:LCA Pattern"). I'm developing methodological corrections to LCA and would like to implement them before the end of my thesis. Semantic Web technologies are a whole field and as a non-specialist I should integrate as much of existing and operational parts. Chris Davis authorised me to experiment on Enipedia and my supervisors finally agreed on allowing me to pursue this way.
