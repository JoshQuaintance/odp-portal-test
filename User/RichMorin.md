__Main motivation for joining ODP community:__ I am a professional programmer, editor, and writer, as well as an aspiring ontologist. I have been studying the design patterns presented in "Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist", so I was pleased to hear about this effort (via Eva Blomqvist's presentation at K-CAP 2009). I am not in a position to offer any ODPs, but I would be happy to offer some "wiki gardening" assistance (eg, fixing language problems, suggesting organization).
