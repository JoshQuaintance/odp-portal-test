__Main motivation for joining ODP community:__ I am currently developing an ontology to assist in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnostic and was looking for a high-level ontology on which to base my work. DUL+DnS appears to me like an excellent starting point for what I wish to accomplish. However, I am fairly new at this and have some basic questions about the right way of doing this and that. I'm looking for a forum that will (patiently) answer those questions and guide me through this (to me) daunting task.
