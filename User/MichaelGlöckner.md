__Main motivation for joining ODP community:__ In my phd-thesis I'm dealing with the topic of cloud logistics. Core idea is the virtualization of physical resources from different providers and encapsulate them in electronicly accessible services. In order to have a common knowledge and understanding about logistics resources and connect them on a common base, ontologies are necessary. Further creating ODP for the logistics domain will help to create reusable logistics blueprints.
